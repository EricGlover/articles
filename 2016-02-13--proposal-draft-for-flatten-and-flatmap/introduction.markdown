A very early draft was [published last week][1] by the ECMAScript editor Brian Terlson. When I say very early I mean it's considered a _"stage -1"_ proposal, meaning it's not even a formal proposal yet, just a very early draft.

That being said, I'm always excited about new `Array.prototype` methods so I decided to write an article nonetheless. These kinds of methods were popularized in JavaScript by libraries like Underscore and then Lodash -- and some of them -- such as `.includes`, have eventually started finding their way into the language.

Shall we take a look?
