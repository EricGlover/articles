This is yet another edition of [ES6 in Depth][1]. First time here? Welcome! So far we covered [destructuring][2], [template literals][3], [arrow functions][4], the [spread operator and rest parameters][5], [object literal features in ES6][6], and last but not least: [what _"classes"_ really mean in ES6][7]. Today is going to be about an assortment of simple language features coming our way in ES6 -- `let`, `const`, and the scary-sounding _"Temporal Dead Zone"_.
