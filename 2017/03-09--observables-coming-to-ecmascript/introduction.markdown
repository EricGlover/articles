Observables in JavaScript were largely popularized by libraries such as [RxJS][rxjs] and [Bacon.js][bacon]. Jafar Husain, a Netflix tech lead and long-time functional programming advocate who's also on TC39 has been developing a proposal to bring observables into the core language. The [`Observable` proposal][prop] is at stage 1 but marked as ready to move up to stage 2, at the time of this writing.
