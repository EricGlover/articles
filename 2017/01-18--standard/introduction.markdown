# A Brief History of JavaScript Standards

Back in 1995, Netscape envisioned a dynamic web beyond what HTML could offer. Brendan Eich was initially brought into Netscape to develop a language that was functionally akin to Scheme, but for the browser. Once he joined, he learned that upper management wanted it to look like Java and a deal to that effect was already underway.

Brendan created the first JavaScript prototype in ten days, taking Scheme's first-class functions and Self's prototypes as its main ingredients. The initial version of JavaScript was code-named Mocha. It didn't have array or object literals, and every error resulted in an alert. The lack of exception handling is why, to this day, many operations result in `NaN` or `undefined`. Brendan's work on DOM level 0 and the first edition of JavaScript set the stage for standards work.
