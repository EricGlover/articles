*Interviewer:* **How did you get started in programming?**

When I was around 11, I had some lessons at school where we learned Flash. We also learned some Frontpage and made websites at school. I made a few websites on my own, just for fun, too. Around this time I started playing StarCraft, which I'd play for almost 10 years straight. I found that their map editing tool was quite complex. You could create _Triggers_ **(when 10 units move into Zone X...)** and _Actions_ to execute in response to those triggers **(...kill those units in a big explosion)**. It wasn't entirely scriptable, but it was always fun figuring out how far you could take this simple rule-based system. It turned out you could render in-game scenes with dialogue and whatnot entirely by using these rules, so I spent quite some time doing that.

In high school, I got into more interesting projects. I implemented my own version of the classic Snake game and my very own Paint. I noticed my computer was too slow for my Paint app to smoothly draw a point over each coordinate the mouse moved over when using the pencil tool. I ended up compromising with an algorithm that'd draw lines between the last point you moused over and the next one. This looked much more smooth and it was good enough if you weren't intentionally trying to break it. Once I implemented this, I was thrilled to discover the original Paint did exactly the same, with sharp lines being drawn if you moved the mouse around very rapidly in a circular fashion.

Then I started playing a different game, Ultima Online. This one didn't come with a map editor, but there was an open-source server called RunUO, and I used to run my own server and implement features for the game. Thatâ€™s how I learned C#. I implemented things like an unsupervised system where people could sign up for a tournament for a period of time, they'd then fight each other in turns using a randomized double-elimination bracket system, and eventually there'd be only the winners left, and fireworks. ðŸŽ‰ Then I made another system that'd look for peak hours with lots of online players and automatically open these tournaments, which were previously scheduled by hand. Even before I implemented the tournament system they were run *entirely* by hand, with the Game Master moving players into the dueling zone, like an animal!

After doing that for a couple years, a friend told me, *"You know, people would actually pay you to do this"* but I was skeptical, C# was too fun and beautiful to be something you could make a living off of. But it was true, and I got a job writing C#.

I think it's the other way around. It never felt it like work to me. I didn't fall out of love with my hobbies because I was doing it for work as well, but I did grow out of gaming after I started working and transitioning into an adult. It's extremely important to work on something you like. Then it wonâ€™t feel like torture when youâ€™re doing it for days. I feel blessed to be able to make a living off of something that I enjoy so much doing.
