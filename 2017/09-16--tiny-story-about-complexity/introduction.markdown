The browser allocates a new process through a system call to the operating system, which shifts some bits around on the physical hardware that lies inside the human's computer. Before the HTTP request hits the network, we need to hit DNS servers, engaging in the elaborate process of casting `google.com` into an IP address. The browser then checks whether there's a ServiceWorker installed, and assuming there isn't one the request finally takes the default route of querying Google's servers for the phrase *"cat in a pickle gifs"*.

Naturally, Google receives this request at one of the front-end edges of its public network, in charge of balancing the load and routing requests to healthy back-end services. The query goes through a variety of analyzers that attempt to break it down to its semantic roots, stripping the query down to its essential keywords in an attempt to better match relevant results.

The search engine figures out the 10 most relevant results for *"cat pickle gif"* out of billions of pages in its index -- which was of course primed by a different system that's also part of the whole -- and at the same time, Google pulls down a highly targeted piece of relevant advertisement about *cat gifs* that matches what they believe is the demographic the human making the query belongs to, thanks to a sophisticated ad network, figures out whether the user is authenticated with Google through an HTTP header session cookie and the search results page starts being constructed and streamed to the human, who now appears impatient and fidgety.
