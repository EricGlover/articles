In this blog, I’ll share a valuable shortcut that can help you turn all images responsive. But first, let’s talk a bit about what responsive images are: an image is considered responsive if it retains its quality on varying device sizes without having an unpleasant impact on performance. 

To better understand this concept, let's take a look at some device dimensions:

#### Possible Full-Width Image Dimensions by Screen Sizes

- **Large/X-Large commercial screens**: 2000+ pixels
- **Websites**: 760 - 1200 pixels
- **Mobile Phones**: < 760 pixels

Let’s assume you have a mobile-first strategy for building responsive apps. You may decide to use 760px images throughout, without considering larger screens. If these images are meant to take the full width of the devices on which they are rendered, then your content will look distorted and unprofessional on websites or commercial screens.

Your next attempt would be to use the largest possible image (2000px) and scale it down based on the screen sizes on which it is displayed.
