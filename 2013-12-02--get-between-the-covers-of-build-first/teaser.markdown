A couple of weeks ago, my book on [JavaScript Application Design][1] and front-end processes _(which I began writing a few months ago)_ finally went into the first review stage. Yesterday, [an early access edition][2] was made available by [Manning][3], this version contains the first 3 chapters, and gives you access to the entire book, which you'll be able to download chapter by chapter, as they get released. Feedback [has been pretty good so far][4].
