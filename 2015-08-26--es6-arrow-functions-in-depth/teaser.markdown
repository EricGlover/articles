The daily saga of [es6-in-depth][1] articles continues. Today we'll be discussing Arrow Functions. In previous articles we've covered [destructuring][2] and [template literals][3]. I strive to cover _all the things_ when it comes to the ES6 feature-set -- and eventually we'll move onto ES7\. I find that writing about these features makes it way easier for them to become **engraved in my skull** as well.
