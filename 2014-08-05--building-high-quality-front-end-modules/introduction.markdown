* Date _and time_ picker
* _Fancy_ [demo site][1]
* Use it on its own, or dedicated to an input
* Concise API and sensible defaults
* Date range just means validating two calendars against each other
* [Doesn't rely on jQuery][2]
* Works on **IE7+**

Rome wasn't conceived with all of these features out-of-the-box, though. When I released it for the first time, it was _just a native date-time picker_ with a reasonable API, but it complete lacked IE support, date validation, and the ability to be used without an input field.
