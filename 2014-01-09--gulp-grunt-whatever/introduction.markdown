Remember Grunt? I've [blogged about it extensively][1] in the past, and I'm [even writing a book][2] which features Grunt as its go-to build tool. It's an awesome _tool_, you should try it some time.

[Some people][3] claim that Grunt will eventually be gulped by Gulp, and surely more will follow. I find this to be [outrageous, egregious, preposterous][4]. It's not as clear cut, Grunt has _a lot of benefits_ over Gulp, and so does Gulp over Grunt.

In this article I aim to **introduce Gulp**, as it's fairly new, having been released _around 6 months ago_. Then, _I'll compare it with Grunt_, pointing out which tool does what better, and why.
