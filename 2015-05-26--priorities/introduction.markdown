Earlier today, [@ppk][1] published [a follow-up post][2], where he mentioned Tim Kadlec [(@tkadlec)][3]'s article on ["Choosing Performance"][4]. Tim rightly asserts that the web is not inherently slow, and that if a site is slow it's merely due to the fact that performance wasn't prioritized by the site's maintainers. Similarly, Jeremy posited that services such as [Instapaper][5] or [Pocket][6] shouldn't have a reason to exist. Besides being well-designed products that many of us use and love, _that shouldn't be the case_, websites should offer that degree of usability, and accessibility on their own, Jeremy argues.

What if we were to **focus just on the content**? Are any prominent "apps" as ad-dollar hungry as the screenshot above?

Everyone seems to agree that **the crux of the issue stems from media deals and dollar-hungry marketers who have little interest in much else than profits**. I tend to agree with that view. Most consumer-facing media rely directly on ad revenue, have little to no regard for their typical user when it comes to the effects these ads have on their experience _(hey, we call them "users" for a reason, right?)_, and simply keep on piling on advertisement.

> _Sure. There's definitely [some excellent original work][7] in there --- in the middle of all those ads and self-links and chrome and value-added "journalism."_

I don't see this trend being anywhere close to slowing down, **quite the contrary**. Video advertising is becoming more and more prominent, huge unoptimized hero images and annoying interstitial dialogs that want you to download a mobile app that's supposed to do what the site you're already on should be doing, along with [ridiculous laws][9], are all becoming lingua franca in web publishing.

All of this wouldn't affect us as web workers if it weren't for the fact that _all the extra cruft is being blamed on the web platform_ itself, as [@ppk][1] and [@tkadlec][3] point out. It's not even just the bloat, but we also keep on [breaking the web][10] by trying to mimic mobile applications, in [one of those desperate attempts][11] to become successful by imitating aspects of a business _(e.g [Google's 80-20 rule][12])_ that have very little to do with their actual success. Scrolljacking, irritating banners that only frustrate the hell out of users who don't want to install your app for no good reason, and similar tactics to drive mobile app usage have done nothing but hurt.

It's time for the web to step up.
