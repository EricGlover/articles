> Like I did in previous articles on the series, I would love to point out that you should probably [set up Babel][1] and follow along the examples with either a REPL or the `babel-node` CLI and a file. That'll make it so much easier for you to **internalize the concepts** discussed in the series. If you aren't the _"install things on my computer"_ kind of human, you might prefer to hop on [CodePen][2] and then click on the gear icon for JavaScript -- _they have a Babel preprocessor which makes trying out ES6 a breeze._ Another alternative that's also quite useful is to use Babel's [online REPL][3] _-- it'll show you compiled ES5 code to the right of your ES6 code for quick comparison._

Before getting into it, let me [_shamelessly ask for your support_][4] if you're enjoying my [ES6 in Depth][5] series. Your contributions will go towards helping me keep up with the schedule, server bills, keeping me fed, and maintaining **Pony Foo** as a veritable source of JavaScript goodies.

Thanks for reading that, and let's go into `Math` improvements. For a bit of context you may want to look at the [extensive article on `Number` improvements][6] from last week. Time to dig into `Math`.
