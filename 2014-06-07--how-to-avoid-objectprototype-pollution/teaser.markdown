Some times you just need to extend `Array` objects. Think of the possibilities. Dream of how **much** **more** **awesome** jQuery would've been if it provided all of the `Array` methods in its **god-object**, instead of re-inventing the wheel. Think how awesome it'd be if the DOM itself provided `Array` objects everywhere, and not just in some places, and not weird `NodeList` objects.
