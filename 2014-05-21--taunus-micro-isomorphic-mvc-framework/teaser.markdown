I've mentioned [Taunus][1] in [one of my latest articles][2]. I believe Taunus _is interesting_, not because it introduces innovative paradigm shifts or the like, but rather, because it takes a proven concept, and iterates upon it. Bluntly put, Taunus builds upon the design of [Rendr][3]. By all accounts, Rendr was amazing. I read a lot about Rendr before even trying it out. I was really excited about it. What could be wrong? I mean, you had convention over configuration, shared rendering, and reused modules. If you tried either Ruby on Rails or _[ASP.NET][4] MVC 3+_, both of those are pretty conventional as well. Eventually, I had to use Rendr in order to determine if it was _"good enough"_ to recommend it in [JavaScript Application Design][5], as the "go-to" approach for shared-rendering in large scale applications.
