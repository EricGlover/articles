# Unwatching All the Things 🙈

This one I learned a while back from [Jessica Lord][jlord]. It may take a while to get used to, but it's well worth it _-- if you ever step into a large GitHub org._

- Go to your account's [Notification Settings][nots] and uncheck the _"Automatically watch repositories"_ checkbox

- Then _-- and this is the harder-to-find tip --_ go to [Watching][wat] and click on <kbd>Unwatch all</kbd>. This will get rid of all repos you were watching but didn't want to.

- You'll then have to individually watch the repos you care about. _Remember to watch repositories you create yourself!_ This is mostly a matter of practice, you'll forget for the first few. I just wish GitHub had more options around this so that you could *auto-watch only your own repositories*.

# Getting rid of Unnecessary Bloat 🐡

For all other things GitHub interface bloat, there is [`refined-github`][refgh]. It's a browser extension that comes in several flavors and hides annoying things like star and fork notifications for your own repositories, add collaborator notifications that spam the hell out of your activity feed, and many more UX improvements and tweaks.

Here's how my feed looks without and with the extension, respectively.

> Highly recommended!

Got any more tips to share? I'd love to hear more in the comments.
