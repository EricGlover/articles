# Head First Public Speaking

I'm thrilled to announce that next month **I'll make my public speaking debut**, at [JSConf US][1] no less! I have also been invited to [QCon NY][3], which is happening mid-June, and another conference which hasn't announced their speaker line-up yet. I'm super-excited about all of this! I haven't given a talk before, and it'll be really interesting to give a few this year.

Back when I wrote [my balance for last year][5], I set a goal for myself to give _at least one talk_ this year, but I was really doubtful I'd get admitted into one of these famous and prestigious conferences. I decided to give it a shot anyways, and I sent proposals to the conferences I liked. Many turned me down because they had _(other)_ awesome speakers lined up, couldn't afford to accomodate my _travel expense_ from and back to Argentina, or because the proposal _didn't quite fit_ with the kind of talks they were looking for. That shouldn't deter you! Try and write a couple of proposals about topics that really, really interest you, and don't be let down by conferences being unable to pick your proposal!

This year also is, coincidentally, **the first year I attended a JavaScript conference**. I was around for [JSFest][6] in San Francisco, and it had really amusing talks. These ranged from the NES console's inner workings, to underwater robots, commanding [CNC][7] machines to draw a JS logo on a piece of wood, and anything mildly related to JS in between. I later attended [JSConf UY][8], which wasn't as _breath-taking_ as [JSFest][6], but it was still worthwhile.

In this brief post, I mostly wanted to share a few tips for those interested in getting into public speaking. Given that I don't have any _tangible knowledge_ about public speaking, I'll just refer you to what I think are great resources you can learn from.

- [Speaking.io][1] is a great collection of resources and teachings from [Zach Holman][2], a GitHub employee
- [@CallbackWomen on Twitter][2] tweets tirelessly about open **CFP** (Call For Proposals), women in tech, and public speaking advice
- [Lanyrd][14] also has a section dedicated to active **CFP**, and you can filter according to your interests
- [Watch Yourself][4] is a reminder that public speaking isn't as terrible as it sometimes is made out to be
- [How to write a compelling proposal][14] is a must-read article!
- USENIX also has an interesting article on [how to tackle a talk proposal][16]
- All of [We Are All Awesome!][15] is a must-read, actually
- [Rehearse!][18]
- If you have any other resources you think I should link to, please post a comment here!

To be honest I mostly relied on Zach's [Speaking.io][1], as it has tons of really good advice regarding both on-stage and off-stage performance. If you're interested in getting into public speaking _at all_, I suggest you **read through the entire site**. It's _not that much_.

Lastly, some obligatory marketing regarding my upcoming book!

# JavaScript Application Design

I'm thrilled to announce that my book has a new cover, now matching the true colors of JavaScript. Behold!

[![cover.jpg][6]][5]

I've been hard at work updating the book, and I'm getting closer to completing it! It now features sample code on a wide variety of topics, listed below.

- Using [package managers and learning Common.JS][10]
- [Backbone and Common.JS][9], using Browserify
- [Writing JavaScript tests][7] with `tape` for the server and the browser
- All kinds of [asynchronous control alternatives][8]
- Wrapping your head around [closures, hoisting, and `this`][10]
- [Encrypting environment configuration][12] for safer version control
- Automating [Heroku deployments][11] through Grunt
- And _much_, [much more][13]!

Naturally, all of the self-contained examples that you can find in the open-source repository are also _discussed at length_ in the book. If you are attending one of the conferences I've mentioned earlier, make sure to stop by my talks and **get a discount code from me!**

##### See you at [JSConf][17]?
