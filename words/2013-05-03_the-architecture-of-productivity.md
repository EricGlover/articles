# The Architecture of Productivity #

It's been a while since I last blogged. I went on vacation, switched jobs, and have been generally busy. I'm now working _full-time remote_, which will _hopefully_ give me some more time to dedicate to this blog.

A few days ago, I read an [interesting rant](https://plus.google.com/116904230181415286707/posts/DnAMAN5sUR8 "His original post"), written by [Ryan Dahl](https://github.com/ry "Ryan Dahl, father of Node.JS"), about software development. It prompted me to write this blog post about it, and share my thoughts on the matter. You can find his post at the end of this entry.

[Ryan](https://github.com/ry "Ryan Dahl") **boldly** indicates that _all that matters in software development is user experience_. I disagree with this. And here's _why_.

While it's true that end user experience is the _single most important aspect_ in software, it's undeniable that there are other aspects of software that should be treated carefully as well. I don't subscribe to the theory that "anything you do beyond doing the bare minimum in order to solve the problem is utterly worthless", which Ryan hints at.

When developing an application, you could always [over-engineer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overengineering "Over-engineering definition"), which is bad, and where I'd agree with Ryan. There are lots of principles you should try and follow here. [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it "You ain't gonna need it") and [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle "Keep it simple, stupid") are important ones in regards to over-engineering.

But _not everything is over-engineering_. Picking and tuning a text editor (in fact, my next blog topic), configuring a more seamless [build](/search/tagged/build "search posts tagged build") process, and learning the ins and outs of your everyday toolset, or more generally things that not _likely_ to change, are all very effective ways to boost your development productivity. And, to me, it doesn't _just end_ with configuring your environment, although it's perhaps the most significant productivity boost you could earn.

Writing clean, _though concise_, application architectures can help to achieve the simplicity demanded by large software projects, while not being strictly directed towards solving the problem at hand. Clean architectures go a tremendous way towards the goal of positive user experiences, speed up development cycles by removing redundancy ([DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself "Don't repeat yourself")), and ensuring that no unexpected bugs are introduced, by making the application more easily testable.

On the subject of not adding to the problem, I couldn't agree more. but that's something that's easily avoidable for the _vast majority_ of software developers out there, who aren't working on languages, compilers, operating systems, or in a sufficiently large company that warrants creating a widely used DSL (such as [FQL](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/ "Facebook Query Language")).

I would reword his conclusion as:

> The single most important aspect in software development is end-user experience, but productivity in day-to-day software development is also **crucial** if you are expected to meet deadlines _today and in the future_. The software development experience might be just as important.

I recommend reading [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/dp/020161622X "The Pragmatic Programmer on Amazon"), if you are interested in learning more on how to be productive while staying on target and be a solid software thinker in general.
