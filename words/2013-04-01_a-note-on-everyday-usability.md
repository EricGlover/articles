# A note on everyday usability #

We can learn a lot about usability just by _observing everyday objects_, applications and interfaces. This morning I was flying to London from Buenos Aires, when I realized _something awkward_ about the UI on the plane's in flight system, which allows you to track the progress and duration of the flight, or occasionally watch a movie.

The UI was _mostly in english_, except for a couple of views which were bilingual, that is, english with an spanish translation below. Additionally, a portion of the flight map would, in turn, be displayed in either english or spanish. This was **further aggravated** by the fact that you couldn't really pick a language on the console, so it didn't really help much if you weren't capable of reading english, and if you were, the **half-baked** spanish translations just _got in your way_.

A similar case might be made about the _in flight announcements_. Although I didn't have a problem with these, personally. All of them were first announced in english, and **the important ones** would also be repeated in spanish. I guess you could make a point about how if an announcement is not _**"important enough to require translation"**_, then _it shouldn't be announced in the first place_, but that's _debatable_.

> Either make the experience bilingual in its entirety, or allow users to pick a language, but _stick to one of those_. Be consistent, don't throw a half-baked feature hybrid at your users. It'll just confuse them.

In this particular situation, I learned that **consistency** is really important. Having a consistent UI design would've saved me the mental leap (albeit a small one).

## Transitioning back to the web. ##

A similar disservice is met on the web quite frequently. Many sites offer _partially translated_ versions of their pages.

Those which try to **force a localization language upon you** are even worse. Rather than referring to your `Accept-Language` HTTP header, or even `navigator.language` in JS, some choose to pick the default language for you _based on your IP address_. I think that **this is plain wrong**, even though _major sites_ such as Google itself do it.

> You should **respect** the _default language preference_ that a user chose, rather than fix them on your _best guess_.

This can be generalized for _just about any aspect_ of usability. Wherever you can, let your users make their choices _by themselves_. Put yourself in the shoes of user with _a particular need_, then figure out what you would change, as the user, to make that goal easier to achieve.

## One last thing ##

When it comes to designing user interfaces, it's hard to come up with a recipe for success. I've found _trying to impersonate the person using an interface_ to be the best way to concoct a succint and elegant design that doesn't get in the way, and, at the same time, makes it _obvious_ how to do what you, as the user, are trying to accomplish. 

> A rule of thumb might be that if it doesn't help you _get there_, then it's _getting in the way_.

Luckily, I brought with me a good book on usability design, [The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465067107 "Look up The Design of Everyday Things on Amazon"). I didn't read all of it yet, but I will surely come back to this topic once I finish reading it.
