# Pony Foo begins #

As I start writing this post, I set out with a purpose. To write a micro-blogging engine. The language of choice is _Node.JS_. I chose this language because I want to see how I fare in light of new horizons...

## Past Lives ##

Keep in mind this idea springed in my mind just yesterday, but I'll try to keep my development cycles **as _lean_ as possible**, in order to entertain myself. In the past most of my self-driven projects lead to nowhere because **I kept focusing on _non-functional aspects_** like performance, code-tuning, including but not limited to implementing wild and new sparkly technologies.

That approach often lead to projects where I would spend a whole year implementing and code-tuning an _MVC_ application in _ASP.NET 3_, which did all the error handling, real-time logging, corner-case handling that you could imagine, but barely consisted of a couple of forms.

This time instead, I'm eager to launch a **minimal version** of the site online _as soon as humanly possible_, and then build on it, adding features on the go. This will also give me the feel of how working with **Node.JS** on a production environment feels like.

## Expectations ##

I come from a strong _C#_ background, although I consider myself to have a pretty decent front-end skillset as well; I figure this will help immensely as I delve into _Node.JS_. I already took care of a few fundamental decisions, which I expect to be able to fulfill:

- [Node.JS](http://youtu.be/jo_B4LTHi3I "Introduction to Node.JS") on the server-side.
- [MongoDB](http://youtu.be/tFp9pZ6U0PE "Introduction to MongoDB") as the database of choice.
- _Javascript_ on the client-side.
- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Introduction to Markdown") will be used to _write_ and _display_ blog posts.

I decided on _Node.JS_ in the back-end because even though it's an entirely _new_ language to me, I sense it will feel familiar working with it, given my past _front-end inclination_. _MongoDB_ felt natural to me, as I find the idea of using _JSON_ across every single layer **very** appealing.

_Javascript_ on the client-side is therefore a no-brainer, and I'll drift away from _development-crippling_ practices I leant towards in the past, like progressive enhancement where I'd support even **noscript**, making development twice as complicated. I'm shifting away from that, in order to be able to maintain the level of _leanness_ I want to achieve here.

_Markdown_ is a simple yet powerful presentation language, and one I feel really comfortable with. Besides there are [open-source distributions](http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/ "pagedown by StackOverflow") that make developing around _Markdown_ a breeze.

The mere notion of having [Javascript](/2013/01/01/javascript-javascript-javascript "Javascript Javascript Javascript") on the server-side, [Javascript](/2013/01/01/javascript-javascript-javascript "Javascript Javascript Javascript") on the client-side, and [Javascript](/2013/01/01/javascript-javascript-javascript "Javascript Javascript Javascript") on the database, makes me extremely enthusiastic about this project going forward. Time will tell how _wondrous_ this actually is, if _at all_.

## Where do we go from here? ##

Right now, I'm writing this post on [_Notepad++_](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad++") and I haven't even begun working on the blog application. Even though I've already allocated a public GitHub repository to the task, and I'm code-naming the project [NBrut](https://github.com/bevacqua/ponyfoo "GitHub repository").

Since I want _leanness_ to be a defining characteristic of how I face **Pony Foo**, I'm using this post as a way to _force myself_ into being able to go live as soon as I'm able to. In order to do that, I have to start by working on implementing _Markdown_, since it's probably the part of the application I'm most comfortable coding. I'll figure out how to solve the rest as I go along.

> **Pony Foo** launched on **_January 18, 2013_**.
