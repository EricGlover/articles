The _event emitter pattern_ was popularized by Node, and is made available in the browser by libraries such as [EventEmitter2][1]. In practice, I haven't seen a lot of use of event emitters in client-side applications, but lately I've been applying it more and more in my code. Here, I'll introduce a modular approach to client-side development I didn't invent, but which I decided to name, anyways.
