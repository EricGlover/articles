I was _never really the camping kind of guy_. Sounds like the perfect opportunity to collect kindling, start a bonfire, set up a tent, sleep in a bedroll, **not have Internet access**, eat hot dogs day and night, feel cold and miserable and get bitten by all sorts of bugs, right? --- overall not my mental picture for _"having fun"_. Last weekend, though, I attended [CampJS][1], and it changed my perspective on this kind of things.
