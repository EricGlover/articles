I've always wanted to visit Australia. My sister has always been fascinated with the country, and she got to go a few years ago. She came back more fascinated about it than ever, validating my drive to visit one day. The problem was obviously one of distance, as visiting other countries usually goes. You're looking at **upwards of half a day** sitting on planes and airports to get from Argentina to an airport anywhere near Australia, but I guess I'm supposed not to complain about that _(and I'm not, I like travelling and I don't mind planes)_.

It all started a couple of months ago. I was sitting in an airport on my way to [Frontend Conference][1] in Switzerland. My flight had just gotten cancelled, so I was stranded in Frankfurt for a couple hours. I couldn't really complain, Lufthansa had upgraded me to Business Class as a token of their appreciation that they'd be cancelling my next two flights with them. I checked my email, and I had one from [Tim][2]. I didn't really know Tim, I followed him [on Twitter][2] and [GitHub][3] but that was about it, I almost hadn't interacted with him at all. This came as a nice surprise!

I had already stumbled upon the site for their conference, it's quite nice --- especially on a cold night. It renders a small world using WebGL and turns your notebook into a little furnace.

Anyways, I didn't hesitate to say yes: this was a great opportunity to visit Australia for a little while, get to know Tim in the flesh _(and as I'd find out later on, a wealth of other great humans)_, and attend a conference to boot!
