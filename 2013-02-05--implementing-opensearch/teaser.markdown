[OpenSearch][1] is an specification that allows websites to improve _usability_. When implemented, it allows consumers to search your site _the way you intended them to_. All major browsers support OpenSearch. **Google Chrome** for instance, allows users to search _OpenSearch-enabled_ websites by using tab in the search bar.
