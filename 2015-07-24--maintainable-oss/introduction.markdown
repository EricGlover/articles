This morning I thought I'd write about maintaining open-source modules. I see a lot of open-source projects online and sometimes they don't get all the issue-triaging love they deserve. It's usually the most popular projects too that end up with **hundreds of open issues** and dozens of in-flight pull requests. I can understand why this happens for individuals who just don't have the time every morning to look at issues and spend maybe 20 minutes a day looking at their issue dashboards on GitHub.

For larger projects, it seems like **wasted opportunity**.
