These are short-form <mark>"thoughts"</mark>, in addition to the usual longer-form articles in the blog. The [goal][1] is to publish [one of these][2] every weekday. I'd love to know what you think. You may send your questions to [thoughts@ponyfoo.com][3]. I'll try to answer them over email and I _may publish them here, with your approval_. I also write _thoughts_ about the <mark>current state of front-end development</mark>, and opinions on other people's articles. You can use the form to the right _(near the bottom in mobile)_ to <mark>subscribe via email</mark>.
