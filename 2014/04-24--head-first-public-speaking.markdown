<div><p>I&#x2019;m thrilled to announce that next month <strong>I&#x2019;ll make my public speaking debut</strong>, at <a href="http://2014.jsconf.us/" target="_blank">JSConf US</a> no less! I have also been invited to <a href="https://qconnewyork.com/" target="_blank">QCon NY</a>, which is happening mid-June, and another conference which hasn&#x2019;t announced their speaker line-up yet. I&#x2019;m super-excited about all of this! I haven&#x2019;t given a talk before, and it&#x2019;ll be really interesting to give a few this year.</p></div>

<div></div>

<div><p>Back when I wrote <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/2014/01/01/a-year-in-review">my balance for last year</a>, I set a goal for myself to give <em>at least one talk</em> this year, but I was really doubtful I&#x2019;d get admitted into one of these famous and prestigious conferences. I decided to give it a shot anyways, and I sent proposals to the conferences I liked. Many turned me down because they had <em>(other)</em> awesome speakers lined up, couldn&#x2019;t afford to accomodate my <em>travel expense</em> from and back to Argentina, or because the proposal <em>didn&#x2019;t quite fit</em> with the kind of talks they were looking for. That shouldn&#x2019;t deter you! Try and write a couple of proposals about topics that really, really interest you, and don&#x2019;t be let down by conferences being unable to pick your proposal!</p> <p><a href="http://2014.jsconf.us/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0QsBxLD.png" alt="jsconf.png"></a> <a href="https://qconnewyork.com/" target="_blank"></a></p> <p>This year also is, coincidentally, <strong>the first year I attended a JavaScript conference</strong>. I was around for <a href="http://jsfest.com/" target="_blank">JSFest</a> in San Francisco, and it had really amusing talks. These ranged from the NES console&#x2019;s inner workings, to underwater robots, commanding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control" target="_blank">CNC</a> machines to draw a JS logo on a piece of wood, and anything mildly related to JS in between. I later attended <a href="http://jsconf.uy/" target="_blank">JSConf UY</a>, which wasn&#x2019;t as <em>breath-taking</em> as <a href="http://jsfest.com/" target="_blank">JSFest</a>, but it was still worthwhile.</p></div>

<div><p>In this brief post, I mostly wanted to share a few tips for those interested in getting into public speaking. Given that I don&#x2019;t have any <em>tangible knowledge</em> about public speaking, I&#x2019;ll just refer you to what I think are great resources you can learn from.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://speaking.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="Because &#x201C;imagine everyone&apos;s naked&#x201D; is terrible advice">Speaking.io</a> is a great collection of resources and teachings from <a href="http://zachholman.com/" target="_blank">Zach Holman</a>, a GitHub employee</li> <li><a href="http://zachholman.com/" target="_blank">@CallbackWomen on Twitter</a> tweets tirelessly about open <strong>CFP</strong> (Call For Proposals), women in tech, and public speaking advice</li> <li><a href="http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html" target="_blank" aria-label="How to write a compelling proposal">Lanyrd</a> also has a section dedicated to active <strong>CFP</strong>, and you can filter according to your interests</li> <li><a href="http://ladiesintech.com/watch-yourself/" target="_blank" aria-label="Watch Yourself">Watch Yourself</a> is a reminder that public speaking isn&#x2019;t as terrible as it sometimes is made out to be</li> <li><a href="http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html" target="_blank" aria-label="How to write a compelling proposal">How to write a compelling proposal</a> is a must-read article!</li> <li>USENIX also has an interesting article on <a href="https://www.usenix.org/blog/how-write-talk-proposal" target="_blank" aria-label="How to Write a Talk Proposal">how to tackle a talk proposal</a></li> <li>All of <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/" target="_blank" aria-label="We Are All Awesome">We Are All Awesome!</a> is a must-read, actually</li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/rehearsal-record-program-output" target="_blank" aria-label="Rehearsal: Record Program Output">Rehearse!</a></li> <li>If you have any other resources you think I should link to, please post a comment here!</li> </ul> <p>To be honest I mostly relied on Zach&#x2019;s <a href="http://speaking.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="Because &#x201C;imagine everyone&apos;s naked&#x201D; is terrible advice">Speaking.io</a>, as it has tons of really good advice regarding both on-stage and off-stage performance. If you&#x2019;re interested in getting into public speaking <em>at all</em>, I suggest you <strong>read through the entire site</strong>. It&#x2019;s <em>not that much</em>.</p> <p>Lastly, some obligatory marketing regarding my upcoming book!</p> <h1 id="javascript-application-design">JavaScript Application Design</h1> <p>I&#x2019;m thrilled to announce that my book has a new cover, now matching the true colors of JavaScript.
