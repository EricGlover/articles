As all of us probably already know, [Speed Matters][1]. Many experiments conducted to analyze human behavior when visiting sites all arrived at similar conclusions. They've determined that slower sites translate directly into loss of interest, less conversions, and may in fact drive your customers straight to the competition!

The [performance improvements have been covered elsewhere][2], though. In this article we'll focus on the _"traditional"_ aspects of UX. We'll be focusing on the changes that were made to the platform as a direct result of user feedback, common sense, and the experience that I've garnered over time.

Namely, we'll use the list presented below as an index of the UX improvements under discussion in the article.

* Landing page experience
* Progressive enhancement
* Commenting experience
* Subscription model
* Styles and fonts
* Links, page titles, and routing
* Search experience and related articles

Let's **step through these points one by one** and see if we can draw conclusions that are helpful _beyond the scope of a simple blogging platform_.
