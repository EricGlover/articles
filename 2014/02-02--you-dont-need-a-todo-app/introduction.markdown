I've never been much of a fan of TODO lists, definitely _never used a TODO application_, and I'm one of those people who have no idea why they even exist, in the first place. Regardless, I've always kept these kinds of lists laying around in a variety of places, some more effective than others.

For instance, I've tried using _Sticky Notes_ in Windows, and Ubuntu, but these never stick with me (bad pun intended). I usually don't even look at them, or I close them, or hide them, it just doesn't do it for me. They're pretty, but they don't get the job done. I end up ditching them every time. You have to find what works well for you. **What kind of task-tracking is making you actually execute on those tasks?**
