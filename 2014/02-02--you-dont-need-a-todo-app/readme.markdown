<div><p>Recently, <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/kpd7ra" target="_blank">a tip on Coderwall</a>, about how to organize your TODO list, brought about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7162131" target="_blank">a discussion on Hacker News</a>. In this brief post, I&#x2019;d like to provide my take on the subject.</p></div>

<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OvMZBs9.jpg" alt="todo.jpg"><figcaption>todo.jpg</figcaption></figure> <p>I&#x2019;ve never been much of a fan of TODO lists, definitely <em>never used a TODO application</em>, and I&#x2019;m one of those people who have no idea why they even exist, in the first place. Regardless, I&#x2019;ve always kept these kinds of lists laying around in a variety of places, some more effective than others.</p> <p>For instance, I&#x2019;ve tried using <em>Sticky Notes</em> in Windows, and Ubuntu, but these never stick with me (bad pun intended). I usually don&#x2019;t even look at them, or I close them, or hide them, it just doesn&#x2019;t do it for me. They&#x2019;re pretty, but they don&#x2019;t get the job done. I end up ditching them every time. You have to find what works well for you. <strong>What kind of task-tracking is making you actually execute on those tasks?</strong></p></div>

<div><p>Sending mails to myself, and keeping them in my Gmail inbox, is something I&#x2019;ve done often to remind myself of things I ought to do. I&#x2019;ve always proudly kept my inbox below ~5 items, and if you can&#x2019;t do that <em>(because apparently it&#x2019;s really hard for people to <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en" target="_blank" aria-label="Using Filters, Gmail Help">use filters in Gmail</a>, or something)</em>, then sending mails to yourself might not be a very good idea. If you are one of the illuminated ones who can keep his inbox clean of spam, then you might want to try it. I also make it a point to create lots of labels and choosing the <em>&#x201C;Show if unread&#x201D;</em> option. The single most important of the labels I use, is <strong>Notes</strong>. I use a filter which tags all my mails to self with that label.</p> <p>I often use <code class="md-code md-code-inline">TODO.md</code> files inside a project root, which usually contain a brief mention of where I left at the previous day, and what steps I was going to do next. Kind of a quick reminder of where I left off so I can quickly pick up the tab the next day. This is a <strong>particularly useful thing to do on fridays</strong> before leaving for home, and also mid-week, when you end the day in the middle the zone, with a bunch of things in your head, which you just know you&#x2019;re going to have <em>completely forgotten</em> by the next morning.</p> <h3 id="a-todo-bash-function">A <code class="md-code md-code-inline">todo</code> bash function</h3> <p>I&#x2019;ve always liked keeping a clean desktop, with absolutely no icons whatsoever. As such, I feel that the best way to keep a TODO list I will actually act upon, is to <strong>have each item be a file in my desktop</strong>. That way, I&#x2019;d always feel the urge to delete the items as soon as possible. Somehow, deep down, I feel this makes me finish my tasks sooner, rather than later. I guess there&#x2019;s something psychology can explain about that. At the very least, it makes me add <em>relevant</em> TODO items, as <strong>I don&#x2019;t want junk laying around</strong> in my precious desktop real estate.</p> <p>Without further ado, behold my <code class="md-code md-code-inline">todo</code> bash function.</p> <pre class="md-code-block"><code class="md-code md-lang-bash"><span class="md-code-comment"># TODO</span>
<span class="md-code-function"><span class="md-code-title">todo</span></span> () {
  IFS_OLD=<span class="md-code-string">&quot;<span class="md-code-variable">$IFS</span>&quot;</span>
  IFS=$<span class="md-code-string">&apos;\n&apos;</span>
  touch $(<span class="md-code-built_in">echo</span> ~/Desktop/<span class="md-code-variable">$@</span>)
  IFS=<span class="md-code-string">&quot;<span class="md-code-variable">$IFS_OLD</span>&quot;</span>
}
</code></pre> <p><code class="md-code md-code-inline">IFS</code> changes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_field_separator" target="_blank" aria-label="Internal field separator, Wikipedia">internal field separator</a> of the shell, and that trick allows my function to <code class="md-code md-code-inline">touch</code> files with spaces on them.</p> <p>Below is a list of usage examples, which will create empty files in my desktop named as the TODO items. Each of these will create a single file.</p> <pre class="md-code-block"><code class="md-code md-lang-bash">todo bugfix
todo feed the cat
todo <span class="md-code-string">&quot;review pull requests&quot;</span>
</code></pre> <h3 id="gmail-desktop-and-more">Gmail, <code class="md-code md-code-inline">~/Desktop</code> and More</h3> <p>Combining all three of these, you get a pretty organized way of going through your day without spending time struggling with TODO apps getting in your way.</p> <p>I use Gmail items to remind myself of tasks I don&#x2019;t have to get to immediately, but maybe at some point in the next month or two. Project level items, which lie in the project directory, change pretty much on a workday-to-workday basis, and contain exactly what I was working on and what&#x2019;s coming up. This is not to be confused with actual planning, which is done in a project management board of some sort: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" target="_blank" aria-label="Jira Project Management and Issue Tracking">Jira</a>, <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Pivotal Tracker">Pivotal</a>, etc. Lastly, the <code class="md-code md-code-inline">todo</code> bash function allows me to add a TODO item on my desktop from my command line, while sitting on any directory, to my desktop.</p> <p>Below is a summary of the tasks I have laying around at the moment.</p> <p><strong>Gmail Inbox + Notes label</strong></p> <ul> <li>a gh notification of an issue I have to resolve at some point</li> <li>an unresolved email about reviewing chapter 2 of my book</li> <li>a link to a camera I want to buy as a present</li> <li>some unread e-books</li> </ul> <p><strong>~/Desktop</strong></p> <ul> <li>fix issues by reviewers and susan (book)</li> <li>update figures (book)</li> </ul> <p><strong>Projects</strong></p> <p>Clean at the moment, I don&#x2019;t have any unfinished tasks, or knowledge which I can&#x2019;t just pick up from the <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Trello Project Management">Trello</a> board.</p> <p>You can find this bash function, and related shell things, <a href="https://github.com/bevacqua/dotfiles/blob/0ba35a82c9d876a92e9841f96f6a2d5da5e345c1/zsh/aliases#L4-L10" target="_blank" aria-label="bevacqua/dotfiles aliases on GitHub">in my dotfiles</a>.</p></div>
