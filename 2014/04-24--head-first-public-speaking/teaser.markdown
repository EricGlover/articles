I'm thrilled to announce that next month **I'll make my public speaking debut**, at [JSConf US][1] no less! I have also been invited to [QCon NY][2], which is happening mid-June, and another conference which hasn't announced their speaker line-up yet. I'm super-excited about all of this! I haven't given a talk before, and it'll be really interesting to give a few this year.
