We're being transparent about [Stompflow][4]'s development, planning on creating bite-sized blog posts at least twice a week, letting you know what the direction we're taking is, and hoping that you'll be able to share your opinions.

If you're interested, you can start by [reading our first blog post][1], following us on Twitter at [@stompflow][2], skimming through [our GitHub organization][3] _(although there isn't much there yet!)_, or [signing up to the launch mailing list][4]!

I vow not to publish any more non-technical blog posts about [Stompflow][4] on this blog in the future!
