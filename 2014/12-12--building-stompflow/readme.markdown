<div><p>A couple of weeks ago I&#x2019;ve started putting together <a href="http://stompflow.com/" target="_blank">Stompflow</a> <em>(although the name only came to life two days ago!)</em>, and it has a blog up. The blog is actually a fork of <a href="https://github.com/ponyfoo/ponyfoo" target="_blank">ponyfoo/ponyfoo</a>, where the styles match the product we&#x2019;re building, but other than that the platform is basically the same as this one.</p> <blockquote> <p>I&#x2019;m really excited about this, and I&#x2019;d appreciate it if you were able to contribute your thoughts and feedback.</p> </blockquote></div>

<div><p>We&#x2019;re being transparent about <a href="http://stompflow.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Stompflow is a hassle-free project management service">Stompflow</a>&#x2019;s development, planning on creating bite-sized blog posts at least twice a week, letting you know what the direction we&#x2019;re taking is, and hoping that you&#x2019;ll be able to share your opinions.</p> <p>If you&#x2019;re interested, you can start by <a href="http://blog.stompflow.com/articles/stompflow-begins" target="_blank" aria-label="Stompflow Begins">reading our first blog post</a>, following us on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/stompflow" target="_blank" aria-label="@stompflow on Twitter">@stompflow</a>, skimming through <a href="https://github.com/stompflow" target="_blank" aria-label="stompflow on GitHub">our GitHub organization</a> <em>(although there isn&#x2019;t much there yet!)</em>, or <a href="http://stompflow.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Stompflow is a hassle-free project management service">signing up to the launch mailing list</a>!</p> <p>I vow not to publish any more non-technical blog posts about <a href="http://stompflow.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Stompflow is a hassle-free project management service">Stompflow</a> on this blog in the future!</p></div>
