I started this blog [two years ago][1], at a time when nobody seemed to care about blogging anymore. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I took back then, and it has helped me develop an online presence that's now the cornerstone of my business. Roughly _a year ago_ I posted ["A Year In Review"][2] as I looked back on my first year of sustained blogging. Today I want to expand on that review, compare this year to the last one, and see how I did!
