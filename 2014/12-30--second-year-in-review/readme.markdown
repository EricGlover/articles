<div><p>I started this blog <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/pony-foo-begins">two years ago</a>, at a time when nobody seemed to care about blogging anymore. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I took back then, and it has helped me develop an online presence that&#x2019;s now the cornerstone of my business. Roughly <em>a year ago</em> I posted <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/a-year-in-review">&#x201C;A Year In Review&#x201D;</a> as I looked back on my first year of sustained blogging. Today I want to expand on that review, compare this year to the last one, and see how I did!</p></div>

<div></div>

<div><h1 id="javascript-application-design">JavaScript Application Design</h1> <p>It&#x2019;s kind of funny how natural blogging feels. I guess that passion is what drove me to write <a href="http://bevacqua.io/bf" target="_blank">JavaScript Application Design</a>, which is <strong>due to come out in January</strong>. <em>(fingers crossed!)</em> I initially conceived it as a <em>&#x201C;Getting Started&#x201D;</em> guide for Node.js containing best practices and tips, but eventually steered towards a more <em>&#x201C;JavaScript all the things&#x201D;</em> kind of book, where I wouldn&#x2019;t take Node.js for granted and instead <strong>focus on quality, regardless of the platform</strong>.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s also humbling how I figured it&#x2019;d come out way earlier than it did: <em>I thought September was a reasonable release date</em>, but it turns out writing a well-polished book takes a lot of effort and a heap of patience. That being said, I&#x2019;m happy the book got to a place where I&#x2019;m not scared of publishing it. Publishing is a scary thing. Once your words become ink in bookshelves, there&#x2019;s no turning back. The idea of getting nasty reviews certainly haunts me from time to time, but I guess it&#x2019;s just something I&#x2019;ll have to learn to live with. Hopefully I get the nice kind of reviews, though.</p></div>

<div><h1 id="pony-foo-as-a-blogging-engine">Pony Foo as a Blogging Engine</h1> <p>When I <a href="https://github.com/ponyfoo/ponyfoo/commit/774d3da4887dc9e776144f4287977a6ca172927e" target="_blank" aria-label="First commit to ponyfoo/ponyfoo on GitHub">started putting together ponyfoo two years ago</a>, it was my first baby steps into the world of Node.js, coming from the .NET and C# universe. I was impressed by how little effort it took to do anything, and everything seemed to be well contained and single-purposed. I fell in love with this idea.</p> <p>It was also my first jab at putting together my own MVC framework, which was a great learning experience that ultimately led me to build <a href="http://taunus.bevacqua.io/" target="_blank" aria-label="Taunus: Micro Isomorphic MVC Engine for Node.js">Taunus</a> this year. The original MVC framework in Pony Foo was too tightly coupled to survive, but it had some nice ideas. It took a conventional approach to input validation and error messaging, didn&#x2019;t use a hash router <em>(you know, those &#x201C;lovely&#x201D; URLs like <code class="md-code md-code-inline">/#!articles/2014</code>)</em>, and it was decent enough to get me started.</p> <p>Then I started dreading it. It did client-side rendering only. It was <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/stop-breaking-the-web" aria-label="Stop Breaking the Web on Pony Foo">breaking the web</a>. It was so very slow. It failed to let web crawlers crawl and it <em>expected them to walk</em>. This is probably the thousandth time I&#x2019;ll say this, but the fact that Google is soon going to become a <em>Web Walker</em> is not enough, not yet. What about Facebook, or LinkedIn <em>(gasp)</em>? They&#x2019;ll crawl your site too, and client-side rendering won&#x2019;t help you.</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I hereby define &quot;Web Walkers&quot; as the client-side-JavaScript-aware evolution for Web Crawlers.</p>&#x2014; Nicolas Bevacqua (@nzgb) <a href="https://twitter.com/nzgb/status/549938982197661696">December 30, 2014</a></blockquote> <p>Luckily, this year I did get around to rewriting the engine. It had gotten to a point where I didn&#x2019;t even want to publish articles. That&#x2019;s how slow it was. If I didn&#x2019;t want to browse my own blog, who would?</p> <p>I compiled <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/critical-path-performance-optimization" aria-label="Critical Path Performance Optimization at Pony Foo">a list of best practices and performance optimizations</a> I put together to make the site faster. Way faster. I&#x2019;m glad I did that. I would&#x2019;ve probably abandoned the blog if it wasn&#x2019;t for the rewrite. As part of the rewrite, I addressed several things people complained about often, such as the ability to post comments without an account, getting rid of the annoying &#x201C;reading time&#x201D; label that followed you around, and the hiragana bullet points.</p> <h1 id="pony-foo-as-a-blog">Pony Foo as a Blog</h1> <p>This year, Pony Foo saw <strong>roughly 250k page views</strong>, compared to the <em>~100k</em> last year. One day in particular hit <em>9520</em> page views, according to Google Analytics, and another hit <em>8848</em> page views.</p> <p><img alt="pageviews.png" title="Screen Shot 2014-12-30 at 12.39.24.png" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/bZHmLsl.png"></p> <p>Just like last year, here&#x2019;s the top ten articles according to page views on Google Analytics.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/gulp-grunt-whatever">Gulp, Grunt, Whatever</a> <em>~33k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/stop-breaking-the-web">Stop Breaking the Web</a> <em>~25.6k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/choose-grunt-gulp-or-npm">Choose: Grunt, Gulp, or <code class="md-code md-code-inline">npm run</code></a> <em>~22k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/my-first-gulp-adventure">My First Gulp Adventure</a> <em>~17k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/css-the-good-parts">CSS: The Good Parts</a> <em>~14k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/angle-brackets-rifle-scopes">Angle Brackets, Rifle Scopes</a> <em>~11k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/grunt-tips-and-tricks">Grunt Tips and Tricks</a> <em>~6.7k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/angle-brackets-synergistic-directives">Angle Brackets, Synergistic Directives</a> <em>~4.7k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/teach-yourself-nodejs-in-10-steps">Teach Yourself Node.js in 10 Steps</a> <em>~4k</em></li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/critical-path-performance-optimization">Critical Path Performance Optimization</a> <em>~3.7k</em></li> </ul> <h1 id="attend-all-the-conferences">Attend <em>all</em> the Conferences!</h1> <p>When I wrote last year&#x2019;s review I had a secret. I wanted to give talks at conferences. I didn&#x2019;t want to write it in that blog post, but I really wanted to do it. Problem is I had never even attended a conference, let alone give a conference talk! In March I went to my first conference ever, <a href="http://sf.jsfest.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="JSFest San Francisco March 2014">JSFest SF</a>. <em>It was so much fun!</em> I even went to a Beer.js meetup. I had never been to a meetup.</p> <p>A week later I went to <a href="http://jsconf.uy/" target="_blank" aria-label="JSConf Uruguay">JSConf UY</a>. Around that time I was asked to speak at <a href="http://2014.jsconf.us/" target="_blank" aria-label="JSConf US 2014">JSConf US</a>, and a week later at <a href="https://qconnewyork.com/ny2014/schedule-2014.html" target="_blank" aria-label="QCon NY 2014 Schedule">QCon NY</a>. JSConf US was exciting, to put it mildly. The location was ridiculous, that&#x2019;s the best word I can come up with to describe it. People were nice, food was amazing, and the event was carefully planned. We played with rockets, I gave interviews <em>(!)</em>, I had fun.</p> <p>Giving my talk, I was terrified. It was a <em>large</em> crowd, these people knew their JavaScript. Still, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0DCZdAruvo" target="_blank" aria-label="Front End Ops Tooling">managed to survive on stage for 20 minutes</a>, even though I would lie if I said thoughts like &#x201C;look at all these people, what are you even doing on stage? hey, get back to the speaking part!&#x201D; didn&#x2019;t cross my mind as I was giving the talk.</p> <blockquote> <p>I don&#x2019;t think the talk itself matters; I was most proud of not running off the stage and locking myself up in a toilet stall.</p> </blockquote> <p>Good thing my talk was on day one, since I was oblivious of everything that was happening around me until the moment I got off stage. Then I could finally enjoy the conference!</p> <p>I think the most important thing in that experience was how nice and reassuring everyone I spoke with after the talk was to me. Over time I did get better, when it comes to nervousness. At QCon there was a much smaller crowd <em>(larger conference, but it had like 10 different tracks)</em>, I had already broke the ice at JSConf so I was more relaxed, confident that I could deliver a better talk even if it was the same title.</p> <p>In August I went to Z&#xFC;rich for the <a href="http://2014.frontendconf.ch/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="Frontend Conference Z&#xFC;rich">Frontend Conference</a>, and this time I gave a different talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ_1_fddWns" target="_blank" aria-label="Browserify All The Things">Browserify All The Things</a>. This was the first time I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. At JSConf I was scared out of my mind until after my talk was over, at QCon I was a bit disappointed at the turnout, since people were spreaded over a lot of different tracks, but at FrontendConf the audience was just right, and I enjoyed giving the talk.</p> <p>Turns out Switzerland is filled with really nice people, who knew? I coincided again with other speakers <em>(namely, <a href="http://twitter.com/rauschma" target="_blank" aria-label="Axel Rauschmayer on Twitter">Axel</a>)</em>, which was kind of nice. I had barely even dabbled in the local scene and I was making friends with distant community members all over the world.</p> <p>Soon afterwards I went to <a href="http://2014.fromthefront.it/" target="_blank" aria-label="From The Front 2014">From The Front</a>, in Italy. The conference was in a nice theater in Bologna. I gave the tooling talk again, had <strong>stupidly tasty</strong> food. <em>Bologna is renowned for its food and foodies.</em> When I finally got back home I decided to attend a few conferences in Buenos Aires, namely <a href="http://rubyconfargentina.org/index_en.html" target="_blank">RubyConf AR</a>, <a href="http://2014.phpconference.com.ar/" target="_blank">PHPConference</a>, and <a href="https://www.jsconfar.com/" target="_blank">JSConf AR</a>.</p> <p>Around then I went to <a href="http://campjs.com/" target="_blank">CampJS</a> in Australia, which I already covered elsewhere, and gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ_1_fddWns" target="_blank" aria-label="Browserify All The Things">the Browserify talk</a> again. When I came back we put together <a href="http://nodeschool.io/buenosaires/" target="_blank" aria-label="NodeSchool BA website">NodeSchool in Buenos Aires</a> for the first time, which had a great turnout.</p> <p>My last conference for the year was <a href="http://oakland.jsfest.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="JSFest Oakland">JSFest Oakland</a>, where I gave the talk on Browserify once again. It was kind of nice, given that <a href="http://sf.jsfest.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="JSFest San Francisco March 2014">JSFest SF</a> was my first conference ever and then I got to give a talk at the event a few months later. JSFest is one of my favorite conference formats, where every day there&#x2019;s typically a driving theme <em>(Browserify, Hapi, CSS, Node.js, etc)</em>, and then an after party of some sort <em>(Gin.js, Beer.js, Dance.js, etc)</em>. What&#x2019;s even better, <strong>it lasted a whole week</strong>!</p> <h1 id="reading">Reading</h1> <p>Unfortunately, my reading slowed down this year. Maybe it was the conferences, maybe it was the book writing, but the fact is that I read a lot less books this year than in 2013. Here&#x2019;s a list.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296" target="_blank">Zero to One</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Year-Without-Pants-WordPress-com-Future/dp/1118660633" target="_blank">The Year Without Pants</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745" target="_blank">Rework</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652" target="_blank">Lean UX</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inspired-Create-Products-Customers-Love/dp/0981690408" target="_blank">Inspired</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Browser-Networking-performance/dp/1449344763" target="_blank">High Performance Browser Networking</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/NoSQL-Distilled-Emerging-Polyglot-Persistence/dp/0321826620" target="_blank">NoSQL Distilled</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Win-Without-Pitching-Manifesto/dp/1605440043" target="_blank">The Win Without Pitching Manifesto</a></li> </ul> <p>Considering you&#x2019;re reading this blog, the one you should definitely read if you haven&#x2019;t already is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Browser-Networking-performance/dp/1449344763" target="_blank">High Performance Browser Networking</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inspired-Create-Products-Customers-Love/dp/0981690408" target="_blank">Inspired</a> is also a great book, but it might not be as relevant. HPBN is an instant classic describing the world under the comfortable hood of HTTP and web browsers.</p> <p>I failed on my mission to read about compilers and operating systems or databases, but I&#x2019;ve already purchased a few books on those topics. Now I just have to read them!</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s hoping 2015 brings about even more conferences to attend!</p></div>
