* [Grunt][1] has a healthy community around it, even on Windows
* It **isn't** used almost exclusively by the Node community
* It's easy to learn, you just pick plugins and configure them
* There's no advanced concepts nor lots of prior knowledge needed

These are all good reasons to use [Grunt][1] to teach build processes, but I want to make it clear that I don't think [Grunt][1] is the single best option out there, and that there are other popular build tools that might fit your needs better than [Grunt][1] will.

I wrote this brief article to help you understand the differences between [Grunt, Gulp, and npm][2], which are the three build tools that I use most often in front-end development workflows. While we're at it, I'll lay out the situations in which a particular tool might be better than the others.
