<div><p>My first book, <a href="http://bevacqua.io/bf/book" target="_blank">JavaScript Application Design</a> is in the final stretch and due to come out very soon! The code samples are finalized and <a href="https://github.com/buildfirst/buildfirst" target="_blank">publicly available on GitHub</a>.

<div><p>You can take a look at the <a href="http://manning.com/bevacqua/JSAD_MEAP_ch1.pdf" target="_blank">first chapter for free</a> which discusses the Build First approach at a high level, and sets the stage for the rest of the book. You can also get <a href="http://manning.com/free/excerpt_bevacqua.html" target="_blank">Appendix D for free</a>, although Manning will ask for your email address in exchange. If anything, you <em>must</em> take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/buildfirst/buildfirst" target="_blank">code samples on GitHub</a>. There&#x2019;s tons of them, and they cover a wild variety of topics!</p> <figure class="figure-has-loaded"><a href="http://bevacqua.io/bf/book" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cee019b251cf09f440b4427541e46cb8.png?s=400" alt="JavaScript Application Design: A Build First Approach"></a></figure></div>

<div><p>The book is currently undergoing the final editing, tech proofing, graphics and copy editing process. Once that&#x2019;s out of the way, there&#x2019;s just manufacturing and shipping left!</p> <h1 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h1> <p>The book offers a new take on web development, where the build process is a first-class citizen. It <strong>covers a wide array of topics in JavaScript development</strong>, from design concepts such as MVC and mastering async to build and deployment techniques, as well as JavaScript basics like scopes, hoisting, and how <code class="md-code md-code-inline">this</code> works.</p> <p>Among others, you&#x2019;ll find:</p> <ul> <li>Insight into tailoring an automated build process and separating it into different flows</li> <li>Different tasks to perform during a build, such as linting, spriting, minification, or even <a href="https://github.com/buildfirst/buildfirst/tree/master/ch02/10_mysql-tasks" target="_blank" aria-label="MySQL Database Tasks">database schema upgrades</a></li> <li>Continuous development techniques to save valuable time on a daily basis</li> <li>Tweaking a build for release with image optimization, caching, and asset hashing</li> <li>Environment configuration, protecting sensitive data, and automating deployments <a href="https://github.com/buildfirst/buildfirst/tree/master/ch04/05_heroku-deployments" target="_blank" aria-label="Deployments with Heroku">over Heroku</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buildfirst/buildfirst/tree/master/ch04/07_aws-deployments" target="_blank" aria-label="Deploying to Amazon EC2">Amazon EC2</a></li> <li>A comparison of RequireJS, using Angular&#x2019;s dependency injection mechanism, and CommonJS</li> <li>An introduction to Browserify as a means to develop more modular code for the client-side</li> <li>Deep analysis of the different techniques for maintainable asynchronous flows. Callbacks, <code class="md-code md-code-inline">async</code>, Promises, event emitters, and generators are all explored!</li> <li>Do you really need jQuery?</li> <li>Building a Backbone application, explaining MVC in the browser, as well as taking that application further using Rendr for shared rendering</li> <li>Writing tests, of course! Tests in the server, tests in the browser, tests using <code class="md-code md-code-inline">tape</code>. Spies in your tests, mocking dependencies, automating tests. Visual testing, performance testing</li> <li>REST API design pricinples and developing layered application architectures</li> </ul> <p>Can&#x2019;t wait to see it in print!
