You can take a look at the [first chapter for free][1] which discusses the Build First approach at a high level, and sets the stage for the rest of the book. You can also get [Appendix D for free][2], although Manning will ask for your email address in exchange. If anything, you _must_ take a look at the [code samples on GitHub][3]. There's tons of them, and they cover a wild variety of topics!
