# JavaScript Application Design

It's kind of funny how natural blogging feels. I guess that passion is what drove me to write [JavaScript Application Design][1], which is **due to come out in January**. _(fingers crossed!)_ I initially conceived it as a _"Getting Started"_ guide for Node.js containing best practices and tips, but eventually steered towards a more _"JavaScript all the things"_ kind of book, where I wouldn't take Node.js for granted and instead **focus on quality, regardless of the platform**.

It's also humbling how I figured it'd come out way earlier than it did: _I thought September was a reasonable release date_, but it turns out writing a well-polished book takes a lot of effort and a heap of patience. That being said, I'm happy the book got to a place where I'm not scared of publishing it. Publishing is a scary thing. Once your words become ink in bookshelves, there's no turning back. The idea of getting nasty reviews certainly haunts me from time to time, but I guess it's just something I'll have to learn to live with. Hopefully I get the nice kind of reviews, though.
