In virtually any creative endeavor in life, _constraints are important_. **Constraints foster creativity.** For instance, I've just recently set a constraint for myself where I would write **a short article** to be published each day of the week, every week. This constraint has re-sparked my interest and my ability to write more frequently on the blog, as I now _"know"_ that I'll get to write whatever I left out -- on the next day. Constraints can be composed of smaller constraints too, this one for example -- to write a short article every week day -- sets an expectation to be able to publish every day, <mark>forcing me to stay consistent</mark> and write at least a little bit every day, something I've been meaning to address ever since I started the blog [over two years ago][1], and it also sets the expectation that those articles _**(or as I've been calling them, "thoughts")**_ should be brief.

Brevity, _in turn_, makes it much easier for me to _be consistent_. It would be unreasonable to expect myself to be able to write long-form articles that would be published every week day, and **still be able to do consulting and open-source work**. Writing brief articles keeps me focused and able to go on about my day job, I allotted time boxes of one hour a day -- maybe two -- to write these _"thoughts"_. See ["What I Learned \[from\] Writing a Haiku Every Day for 100 Days"][2] as another example of someone who commited themselves to writing a bit every day. Or, consider the _(now defunct)_ [DailyJS website][3] as yet another example.

Constraints define our work, our lives. They are everywhere.
