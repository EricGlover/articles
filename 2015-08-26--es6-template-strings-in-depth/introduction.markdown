Template literals are a new feature in ES6 to make working with strings and string templates easier. You wrap your text in `` `backticks` `` and you'll get the features described below.

* You can interpolate variables in them
* You can actually interpolate using _any kind of expression_, not just variables
* They can be **multi-line**. _Finally!_
* You can construct _raw templates_ that don't interpret backslashes

In addition, you can also define _a method_ that will decide what to make of the template, instead of using the default templating behavior. There are some interesting use cases for this one.
