Back when I wrote [my balance for last year][1], I set a goal for myself to give _at least one talk_ this year, but I was really doubtful I'd get admitted into one of these famous and prestigious conferences. I decided to give it a shot anyways, and I sent proposals to the conferences I liked. Many turned me down because they had _(other)_ awesome speakers lined up, couldn't afford to accomodate my _travel expense_ from and back to Argentina, or because the proposal _didn't quite fit_ with the kind of talks they were looking for. That shouldn't deter you! Try and write a couple of proposals about topics that really, really interest you, and don't be let down by conferences being unable to pick your proposal!

This year also is, coincidentally, **the first year I attended a JavaScript conference**. I was around for [JSFest][5] in San Francisco, and it had really amusing talks. These ranged from the NES console's inner workings, to underwater robots, commanding [CNC][6] machines to draw a JS logo on a piece of wood, and anything mildly related to JS in between. I later attended [JSConf UY][7], which wasn't as _breath-taking_ as [JSFest][5], but it was still worthwhile.
