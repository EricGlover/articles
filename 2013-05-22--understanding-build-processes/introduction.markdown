The single most important aspect of even resorting to a build system is producing a **one-step build process**. This means doing everything with a simple command, such as `grunt dev`. We'll look at ways to make that happen, and how to improve it as your applications grow. I'll also mention some of the most common tasks in the process, as well as some that aren't _as widely adopted_.

Even though I'll be talking about [Grunt][1], I won't get _intimate_ with the tool itself. The concepts I'll describe should apply to any decent build tool you might pick for the job.
