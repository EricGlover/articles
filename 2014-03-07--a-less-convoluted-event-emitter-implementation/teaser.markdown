I believe that the event emitter implementation in Node could be made way better by providing a way to access the functionality directly without using prototypes. This would allow to simply extend any object, such as `{}`, or `{ pony: 'foo' }`, with event emitting capabilities. Prototypes enforce limitations for little gain, and that's what we avoid by going around it and merely adding methods on existing objects, without any prototypal inheritance going on.
