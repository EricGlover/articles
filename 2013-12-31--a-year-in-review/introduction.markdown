I spent _lots_ of my spare time, learning Node.js and putting together the blogging engine, taking my C# knowledge, and putting it to use in JavaScript. JavaScript in the server, amazing stuff! More importantly, I learned a lot about Unix systems, and [walked away from Windows-only programs][1] for good, at least when it comes to software development. Node taught me how to write cross-platform code which just works, and that has been a rewarding take away for me. I learned a lot simply because Node was doing less on my behalf.

In this brief post I'll talk about some of my experiences throughout 2013\.
