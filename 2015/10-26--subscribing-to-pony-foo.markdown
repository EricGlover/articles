<div><p>Almost since <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/first" aria-label="Pony Foo Begins">day one</a> you could follow Pony Foo using the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/feed">RSS feed</a>. Now there&#x2019;s quite a few more options. I&#x2019;d love to know what&#x2019;s your favorite and also maybe help me make your reading experience better.</p></div>

<div><p>There&#x2019;s quite a few different ways of subscribing to Pony Foo today.</p> <h1 id="rss-feed">RSS Feed</h1> <p>You can subscribe to the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/feed">RSS feed</a> using an RSS client like <a href="http://newsblur.com/" target="_blank">newsblur.com</a> or <a href="http://feedly.com/" target="_blank">feedly.com</a>.</p> <p><img alt="An example showing the Pony Foo feed on Feedly" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/lBHxXP6.png"></p> <p>You&#x2019;ll then see new articles pop up on your feed reader as they come out.</p> <h1 id="email-subscription">Email Subscription</h1> <p>You can subscribe to get email updates whenever an article comes out. You can subscribe completing <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/subscribe">this form</a> with just your email address. You&#x2019;ll get a single email whenever an article comes out, containing the gist of the article and a <em>&#x201C;Read More&#x201D;</em> button.</p> <p><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/subscribe"><img alt="Sample email from Pony Foo" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/nGYlVMf.png"></a></p> <h1 id="facebook-page">Facebook Page</h1> <p>I created a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Pony-Foo-824774767640495/" target="_blank">Facebook Page for Pony Foo</a> a few hours ago. If you have a Facebook account you can just <em>Like</em> the page and then you&#x2019;ll get updates right in your timeline as new articles come out.</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Pony-Foo-824774767640495/" target="_blank"><img alt="Screenshot of the Facebook Page for Pony Foo" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/c3avDNC.png"></a></p> <p>I hear some people prefer following news right on Facebook instead of over email, so that&#x2019;s possible now too. Whenever an article comes out, the Page will be updated with a link to the article.</p> <h1 id="on-twitter">On Twitter</h1> <p>Pony Foo <a href="https://twitter.com/ponyfoo" target="_blank">(@ponyfoo)</a> has been on Twitter for a while now. The account automatically posts articles immediately as they come out, and from time to time I also retweet stuff with that account.</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ponyfoo" target="_blank"><img alt="An screenshot of the @ponyfoo account on Twitter" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ek7a8Cp.png"></a></p> <p>I may or may not reply to mentions, and you&#x2019;ll probably have better luck reaching me at <a href="https://twitter.com/nzgb" target="_blank">@nzgb</a> &#x2013; my main Twitter account.</p> <h1 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h1> <p>Articles are also usually posted to <a href="http://www.echojs.com/" target="_blank">EchoJS</a>, a JavaScript news aggregator; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>, the well-known incubator&#x2019;s link aggregator; and <a href="https://lobste.rs/" target="_blank">Lobste.rs</a>, an invite-based alternative to Hacker News. While my articles aren&#x2019;t the only thing on these places, a lot of the content shared on these platforms is pure gold.</p></div>
