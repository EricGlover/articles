<div><p>These are short-form <mark class="md-mark">&#x201C;thoughts&#x201D;</mark>, in addition to the usual longer-form articles in the blog. The <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/food-for-thought-begins">goal</a> is to publish <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/food-for-thought">one of these</a> every weekday. I&#x2019;d love to know what you think. You may send your questions to <a href="mailto:thoughts@ponyfoo.com">thoughts@ponyfoo.com</a>. I&#x2019;ll try to answer them over email and I <em>may publish them here, with your approval</em>. I also write <em>thoughts</em> about the <mark class="md-mark">current state of front-end development</mark>, and opinions on other people&#x2019;s articles. You can use the form to the right <em>(near the bottom in mobile)</em> to <mark class="md-mark">subscribe via email</mark>.</p></div>

<div><p>In virtually any creative endeavor in life, <em>constraints are important</em>. <strong>Constraints foster creativity.</strong> For instance, I&#x2019;ve just recently set a constraint for myself where I would write <strong>a short article</strong> to be published each day of the week, every week. This constraint has re-sparked my interest and my ability to write more frequently on the blog, as I now <em>&#x201C;know&#x201D;</em> that I&#x2019;ll get to write whatever I left out &#x2013; on the next day. Constraints can be composed of smaller constraints too, this one for example &#x2013; to write a short article every week day &#x2013; sets an expectation to be able to publish every day, <mark class="md-mark">forcing me to stay consistent</mark> and write at least a little bit every day, something I&#x2019;ve been meaning to address ever since I started the blog <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/pony-foo-begins">over two years ago</a>, and it also sets the expectation that those articles <em><strong>(or as I&#x2019;ve been calling them, &#x201C;thoughts&#x201D;)</strong></em> should be brief.</p> <p>Brevity, <em>in turn</em>, makes it much easier for me to <em>be consistent</em>. It would be unreasonable to expect myself to be able to write long-form articles that would be published every week day, and <strong>still be able to do consulting and open-source work</strong>. Writing brief articles keeps me focused and able to go on about my day job, I allotted time boxes of one hour a day &#x2013; maybe two &#x2013; to write these <em>&#x201C;thoughts&#x201D;</em>. See <a href="https://medium.com/the-lighthouse/what-i-learned-writing-a-haiku-every-day-for-100-days-ad23865ef760" target="_blank">&#x201C;What I Learned [from] Writing a Haiku Every Day for 100 Days&#x201D;</a> as another example of someone who commited themselves to writing a bit every day. Or, consider the <em>(now defunct)</em> <a href="http://dailyjs.com/" target="_blank">DailyJS website</a> as yet another example.</p> <p>Constraints define our work, our lives. They are everywhere.</p></div>

<div><p>A few months back, <a href="https://twitter.com/amandaglosson" target="_blank" aria-label="@amandaglosson on Twitter">Amanda</a> pointed out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKkYcetGWjA" target="_blank" aria-label="Constraints are not Compromises &#x2014; talk by @amandaglosson at JSFest Oakland">power of constraints</a>, and <strong>it <em>felt</em> obvious</strong>. Yet, it has to be pointed out. Then, it <mark class="md-mark"><em>becomes</em></mark> obvious. If you look at great works of art or design, constraints are, for the most part, what drove these artists. In terms of painting &#x2013; <em>or systems design</em> &#x2013; It&#x2019;s not about what more you can add to your work, or what else you can take out.</p> <h4 id="it-s-mostly-about-what-you-let-yourself-leave-out-in-the-first-place">It&#x2019;s mostly about <em>what you let yourself leave out</em>, in the first place.</h4> <p>Consider performance and the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/measure-optimize-automate" aria-label="Measure, Optimize, Automate on Pony Foo">interesting concept of performance budgets</a>, where you define a hard lower boundary for how responsive your app or service should be. Here we are defining constraints such as <em>&#x201C;the total page weight must be <strong>under 1MB</strong> for initial page load&#x201D;</em> or <em>&#x201C;requests against the landing page must attain a <strong>SpeedIndex</strong> score under 1000&#x201D;</em>. Consider design and constraints such as <em>&#x201C;we must not use images for layout&#x201D;</em>, <em>&#x201C;we must pick, at most, two custom fonts&#x201D;</em>, or <em>&#x201C;all icons must be <code class="md-code md-code-inline">32px</code> by <code class="md-code md-code-inline">32px</code> in size&#x201D;</em>. These are not exactly orthogonal concepts, quite the opposite actually. Design must be tackled with performance in mind if are to take performance seriously. We need to work together with our design teams so that we don&#x2019;t end up slaves to multiple font downloads <em>(or even worse, scripts)</em>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>It&#x2019;s not so much about the web being slow as it is us that are making it slow by not enforcing enough constraints.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Constraining yourself on purpose is not even only useful when you&#x2019;re writing <em>(prose)</em>, designing, or defining performance expectations! It&#x2019;s also great when writing code &#x2013; a very different form of writing.</p> <p>Constraints in code may crop up as &#x201C;using only <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/" target="_blank" aria-label="JavaScript: The Good Parts">&#x2018;the good parts&#x2019;</a> in JavaScript&#x201D;, following <a href="https://github.com/bevacqua/js" target="_blank" aria-label="bevacqua/js on GitHub">style guides</a>, developing code in <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/great-web-module-compendium" aria-label="The Great Web Module Compendium on Pony Foo">small modules</a> and <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/testing-javascript-modules-with-tape" aria-label="Testing JavaScript Modules with Tape">writing tests</a> for it. Similar kinds of constraints can be seen everywhere in the world of software development, and the universe at large.</p> <p>What kind of constraints do you set upon yourself?
