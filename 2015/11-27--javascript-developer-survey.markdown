<div><p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/javascript-developer-survey-results" target="_blank" aria-label="JavaScript Developer Survey Results on Pony Foo">Results are in!</a> Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer to this poll. See you again next year!</p> <p>You can find the survey on <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/XTch5hfcJQ" target="_blank" aria-label="JavaScript Developer Survey on Google Forms">Google Forms</a>. I&#x2019;ve compiled a list of questions that includes some that were asked by Alex on his last survey, a few I came up with, and a few I know other people are curious about.</p> <p>I encourage you to take a look and come up with your answers. They&#x2019;re 30 questions but the vast majority are multiple choice questions, so it shouldn&#x2019;t take more than a few minutes to fill out the form.</p> <p><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/XTch5hfcJQ" target="_blank" aria-label="JavaScript Developer Survey on Google Forms"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0mXmqda.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the survey"></a></p></div>

<div><p>I&#x2019;ll be publishing the results in three weeks, as to ensure most people have time to fill out the form if they desire.</p> <p>Besides answering the &#x201C;hard data&#x201D; questions I&#x2019;d be very curious to hear out any comments in the &#x201C;Other&#x201D; fields and particularly in the last question which lets you go deeper into any topics that you felt weren&#x2019;t covered by the rest of the questionnaire.</p></div>
