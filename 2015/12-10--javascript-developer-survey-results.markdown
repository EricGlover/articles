<div><p>The end of year is drawing close and the JavaScript Developer Survey has now ended. The survey received an unimagined amount of replies and I&#x2019;m excited to share the results with you!</p></div>

<div></div>

<div><p>There were <strong>over 5000 responses</strong>, 5350 to be exact, and I can&#x2019;t wait to share the details. Before that I want to thank everyone who chipped in. This is a great time to be a part of the JavaScript community, and I&#x2019;m truly excited for things to come!</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t anticipate such high interest, and next time I&#x2019;ll make some improvements to the format. Namely, I&#x2019;ll put the survey up on GitHub first so that the community can collaborate on the questions and options for a couple of weeks before launching the survey. That way, I&#x2019;ll be able to produce more accurate results and avoid complaints like <em>&#x201C;I am shocked you didn&#x2019;t include Emacs!&#x201D;</em>.</p> <p>Now, onto the survey results. I&#x2019;ll remain impartial in delivering the results, so that you can come to your own unbiased conclusions.</p></div>

<div><h1 id="what-type-of-javascript-do-you-write">What type of JavaScript do you write?</h1> <p>A whooping 97.4% of respondents write JavaScript for a web browser, while 37% of them write mobile web applications. Over 3000 of them &#x2013; with 56.6% &#x2013; also write server-side JavaScript. Among those who took the poll, 5.5% use JavaScript in some sort of embedded environment, such as Tessel or a Raspberry Pi.</p> <p>A few participants replied they use JavaScript in some other places, notably in developing CLI and desktop applications. A few also mentioned Pebble and Apple TV. These fell in the <strong>Other</strong> category, with 2.2% of the votes.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the first question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/c0q4LvI.png"></p> <h1 id="where-do-you-use-javascript">Where do you use JavaScript?</h1> <p>Unsurprisingly, 94.9% of voters use JavaScript at work. However, a large portion of the tallied &#x2013; with 82.3% of the votes &#x2013; also use it on side projects. Other responses included for teaching and learning, for fun, and for non-profits.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the second question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/K5nSsyr.png"></p> <h1 id="how-long-have-you-been-writing-javascript">How long have you been writing JavaScript?</h1> <p>Over 33% of the surveyed have been writing JavaScript code for over six years. Out of those who answered the poll, 5.2% started at most a year ago, 12.4% two years ago, and 15.1% three years ago. That makes it 32.7% people who started writing JavaScript in recent years, out of 5350 voters.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the third question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/P5ev9fL.png"></p> <h1 id="which-compile-to-javascript-languages-do-you-use-if-any">Which compile-to-JavaScript languages do you use, if any?</h1> <p>A whooping <strong>85%</strong> replied that they compile ES6 into ES5. Meanwhile 15% still use CoffeeScript, 15.2% use TypeScript, and a measly 1.1% reported they use Dart.</p> <p>This was one of the questions I wish I&#x2019;d approached more collaboratively, as it got 13.8% of <em>&#x201C;Other&#x201D;</em> responses. The vast majority of these answers were ClojureScript, elm, Flow, and JSX.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the fourth question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/12mL6u6.png"></p> <h1 id="what-javascript-stylistic-choices-do-you-prefer">What JavaScript stylistic choices do you prefer?</h1> <p>The vast majority of JavaScript developers who answered the poll seem to favor semicolons, at 79.9%. In contrast, 11% indicated they prefer not to use semicolons. When it comes to commas, 44.9% favor to place them after an expression, while 4.9% prefer to use comma-first syntax. When it comes to indentation, 65.5% prefer spaces, while 29.1% would rather use tabs.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the fifth question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/xwFVmS1.png"></p> <h1 id="which-es5-features-do-you-use">Which ES5 features do you use?</h1> <p>While 79.2% of respondents are on board with functional <code class="md-code md-code-inline">Array</code> methods, and 76.3% indicated they use strict mode, <code class="md-code md-code-inline">Object.create</code> sees a 30% adoption and getters and setters are only used by 28%.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the sixth question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/W9pUOua.png"></p> <h1 id="which-es6-features-do-you-use">Which ES6 features do you use?</h1> <p>Notably, arrow functions are the most used ES6 feature among those who took the poll: 79.6%. Let and const together took 77.8% of the pollsters, and promises are also strong with 74.4% adoption. Unsurprisingly, only 4% of the respondents have played around with proxies. Only 13.1% of users indicated they&#x2019;ve used symbols, while over 30% say they use iterators.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the seventh question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/okcvuos.png"></p> <h1 id="do-you-write-tests">Do you write tests?</h1> <p>While 21.7% never write any tests, most do write some tests, and 34.8% always write tests.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the eighth question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/0C944YL.png"></p> <h1 id="do-you-run-continuous-integration-tests">Do you run Continuous Integration tests?</h1> <p>There&#x2019;s a similar story with CI, although many more people don&#x2019;t use a CI server &#x2013; over 40%. Almost 60% of respondents use CI at least sometimes, of which 32% always run tests on a CI serve.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the ninth question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/P04bJHG.png"></p> <h1 id="how-do-you-run-tests">How do you run tests?</h1> <p>59% like to run automated browser tests with PhantomJS or similar, and 51.3% also prefer to perform manual testing on a web browser. Automation in server-side tests amounts to 53.5% votes.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the tenth question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/v09gVdQ.png"></p> <h1 id="what-unit-testing-libraries-do-you-use">What unit testing libraries do you use?</h1> <p>It would seem most voters prefer either Mocha or Jasmine to run their JavaScript tests, although Tape received a healthy 9.8% of the ballots.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the eleventh question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/20nUzJu.png"></p> <h1 id="what-code-quality-tools-do-you-use">What code quality tools do you use?</h1> <p>It would seem like respondents are divided between ESLint and JSHint, but JSLint is surprisingly strong after all these years, at almost 30%.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 12th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/RC8ePwr.png"></p> <h1 id="how-do-you-prefer-handling-client-side-dependencies">How do you prefer handling client-side dependencies?</h1> <p>npm took over as the client-side dependency management system of choice, with 60% of the votes casted their way. Bower still holds 20% of the audience, and plain old <code class="md-code md-code-inline">&lt;script&gt;</code> downloading and insertion managed to get 13.7% votes.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 13th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/TOQiSZP.png"></p> <h1 id="what-s-your-preferred-build-script-solution">What&#x2019;s your preferred build script solution?</h1> <p>Build tooling choices are divided, partially due to the healthy amount of different options to choose from. Gulp is the most popular, with over 40% of the votes. Using <code class="md-code md-code-inline">npm run</code> is close by, at 27.8%, and Grunt got 18.5% of the audience.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 14th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/xXlEE3E.png"></p> <h1 id="what-s-your-preferred-javascript-module-loading-tool">What&#x2019;s your preferred JavaScript module loading tool?</h1> <p>At the moment, it would seem as most people are torn between Browserify and Webpack, although the latter leads by almost 7 points. 29% of users indicated they use transpile Babel modules first, before presumably using one of the two aforementioned tools to pack their modules together.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 15th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/pQPMC7V.png"></p> <h1 id="what-libraries-do-you-use">What libraries do you use?</h1> <p>In retrospect, this was one of the questions which would&#x2019;ve benefitted a lot from collaborative editing. jQuery is still going strong, with over 50% of votes casted its way. Lodash and underscore are used by a significant portion of the JavaScript population that participated in the voting, while the <code class="md-code md-code-inline">xhr</code> micro library only clocked in 8% of the votes.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 16th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/7jAwy05.png"></p> <h1 id="what-frameworks-do-you-use">What frameworks do you use?</h1> <p>Unsurprisingly, React and Angular are leading the pack. Backbone is still in a healthy position, with 22.8% of the votes.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 17th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/zpSAISK.png"></p> <h1 id="do-you-use-es6">Do you use ES6&#x2026;</h1> <p>Responses were quite divided in this question, with almost 20% never using ES6, over 10% using it exclusively, close to 30% using it extensively and almost 40% using it occasionally.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 18th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/hAnbtfN.png"></p> <h1 id="do-you-know-what-s-coming-in-es2016">Do you know what&#x2019;s coming in ES2016?</h1> <p>Roughly speaking, half of the voters don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s coming in ES2016, while the other half have an idea of what&#x2019;s coming next.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 19th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/DxxOnco.png"></p> <h1 id="do-you-understand-es6">Do you understand ES6?</h1> <p>Over 60% of respondents seem to understand the basics, while 10% have no idea about ES6 and over 25% consider they understand ES6 really well.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 20th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/w6obK3X.png"></p> <h1 id="would-you-say-es6-is-an-improvement">Would you say ES6 is an improvement?</h1> <p>Almost 95% of the respondents consider ES6 to be an improvement to the language. I&#x2019;ll congratulate TC39 members next time I run into them!</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 21th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/c0RtfVK.png"></p> <h1 id="what-are-your-preferred-text-editors">What are your preferred text editors?</h1> <p>Again, very divided because of the variety of options. Over half the respondents like Sublime Text, and over 30% like to use Atom, its open-source clone. Over 25% voted for WebStorm and also for vi/vim.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 22th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Vt8ve7s.png"></p> <h1 id="what-s-your-preferred-development-os">What&#x2019;s your preferred development OS?</h1> <p>Over 60% of voters use Mac, while Linux and Windows users are close to 20% each.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 23th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/PmLbtAo.png"></p> <h1 id="how-do-you-find-reusable-code-libraries-and-tools">How do you find reusable code, libraries and tools?</h1> <p>Respondents seem to favor GitHub and search engines, but there&#x2019;s also a healthy dose of blogs, Twitter, and the npm website being consumed.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 24th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/HpmV9yz.png"></p> <h1 id="do-you-engage-in-social-javascript-events">Do you engage in social JavaScript events?</h1> <p>Almost 60% have attended at least a conference, while 74% indicated they like going to meetups.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 25th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EnQWGzf.png"></p> <h1 id="what-browsers-do-you-support-in-your-javascript-applications">What browsers do you support in your JavaScript applications?</h1> <p>Quite divided answers, but fortunately most of respondents don&#x2019;t have to deal with customers on IE6 anymore.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 26th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/BV3eU0X.png"></p> <h1 id="do-you-learn-about-javascript-latest-features-on-a-regular-basis">Do you learn about JavaScript latest features on a regular basis?</h1> <p>Around 80% of respondents try and stay up to date when it comes to the latest JavaScript features.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 27th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/5TZUW2i.png"></p> <h1 id="where-do-you-learn-about-the-latest-javascript-features">Where do you learn about the latest JavaScript features?</h1> <p>Unsurprisingly, the top-notch Mozilla Developer Network is leading the pack in terms of JavaScript documentation and news. JavaScript Weekly is also a very popular source of news and articles at almost 40% of respondents.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 28th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/7Jlg7zh.png"></p> <h1 id="which-of-these-features-have-you-heard-about">Which of these features have you heard about?</h1> <p>Over 85% of voters have heard about ServiceWorker, although I&#x2019;d be curious to know how many of those have played around with it!</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 29th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/8o3Jq2R.png"></p> <h1 id="what-languages-do-you-use-primarily-besides-javascript">What languages do you use primarily, besides JavaScript?</h1> <p>There&#x2019;s so many languages to choose from, I was bound to forget a few, but the results speak for themselves.</p> <p><img alt="An screenshot of the percentages for the 30th question" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Tv9NciV.png"></p> <h1 id="thanks">Thanks!</h1> <p>Lastly, I wanted to thank everyone who took part of the poll. It was far more popular than I anticipated and I&#x2019;m looking forward to holding a similar poll next year. Hopefully, it&#x2019;ll be one that&#x2019;s even more diverse and perhaps a bit less biased.</p> <blockquote> <p>What are your take-aways from the survey?</p> </blockquote></div>
