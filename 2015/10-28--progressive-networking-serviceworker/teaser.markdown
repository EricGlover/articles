I've been toying with [`ServiceWorker`][1] for a while. The single most complicated issue when it comes to `ServiceWorker` has been dealing with caching in a straightforward way. In [my previous article][1] -- an introduction to `ServiceWorker` -- I wrote about a few different strategies: hitting the network first, hitting the cache first, and hitting the cache but going to the network nevertheless to get _"eventually fresh"_ content. The last one I mentioned was hitting the cache, going to the network nevertheless, and somehow using `postMessage` to relay updates back to web pages showing stale content. In this article, we'll explore how to communicate from a `ServiceWorker` to a web page and back.
