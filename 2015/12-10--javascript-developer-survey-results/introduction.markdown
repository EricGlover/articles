There were **over 5000 responses**, 5350 to be exact, and I can't wait to share the details. Before that I want to thank everyone who chipped in. This is a great time to be a part of the JavaScript community, and I'm truly excited for things to come!

I didn't anticipate such high interest, and next time I'll make some improvements to the format. Namely, I'll put the survey up on GitHub first so that the community can collaborate on the questions and options for a couple of weeks before launching the survey. That way, I'll be able to produce more accurate results and avoid complaints like _"I am shocked you didn't include Emacs!"_.

Now, onto the survey results. I'll remain impartial in delivering the results, so that you can come to your own unbiased conclusions.
