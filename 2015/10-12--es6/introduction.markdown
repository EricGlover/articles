I heard you like bullet points, so I made an article containing hundreds of those bad boys. To kick things off, here's a table of contents with all the topics covered. It has bullet points in it -- **obviously**. Note that if you want these concepts to permeate your brain, you'll have a much better time learning the subject by going through the [in-depth series][1] and playing around, experimenting with ES6 code yourself.
