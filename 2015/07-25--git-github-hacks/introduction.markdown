There are some neat tricks you can do to improve your life on GitHub, -- and when using `git` -- as well as the lives of those around you. I wanted to showcase some of them here. Let's start with a browser extension.

# GitHub Linker

This browser extension allows you to navigate across CommonJS `require` calls and `package.json` declarations simply by clicking on the linkified names of the packages. It's quite convenient.

Naturally, you can get it [on GitHub][1].
