We've been hard at work last week analyzing how to build a [universal][1] app using React. First we [looked at the bare minimum needed][2] to run _Babel through Browserify for ES6 and JSX support_, as well as how to render a basic app seamlessly in the server and the browser. On friday [we added `react-router`][3] so that _view routing is handled for us_ on both the server-side as well as the client-side -- universally. Today we'll be **making some tweaks** to what we have so far.
