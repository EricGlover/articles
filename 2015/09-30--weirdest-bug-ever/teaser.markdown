I wanted to take a step back from all of the ES6 articles that have been popping up on Pony Foo lately to talk about a bug I came across last week. As I mentioned yesterday, the first thing I did during the [redesign](/articles/redesign "Pony Foo Gets a Face Lift") was to come up with an animated version of the logo, but some fringe events started to occur when I tried to embed it into the site.
