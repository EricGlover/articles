I finally got around to trying out React, and this blog post will detail my initial impressions as well as a tutorial on how to make your React apps universal from the get-go. As usual, I have a long-standing need to refactor [bevacqua.io][1], as well as a long-standing desire to finally try out ES6 through [Babel][2], React, and JSX. I've passively read a lot on the subject but hadn't actually dipped my toes on any of it, so I figured I'd put my fingertips where my eyeballs were at -- hoping not to poke myself. I came across a bit of free time and decided this was the perfect moment to put Babel and ES6 in practice.
