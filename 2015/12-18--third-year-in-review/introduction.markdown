During the course of 2015, **I wrote and published 67 articles**, which is remarkably close to the total of 81 articles I had published so far, in previous years. For the most part, the surge of publications in 2015 can be explained by a little experiment I tried where I wanted to see what it'd be like to blog daily. That experiment ended with the longest-standing series I've written for Pony Foo, my [ES6 in Depth][2] series, consisting of _24 articles_ and a summarization of [everything there is to know about ES6][3], published over the course of a month.

- [2015](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/2015 "Articles published in 2015"): published 67 articles
- [2014](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/2014 "Articles published in 2014"): published 30 articles
- [2013](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/2013 "Articles published in 2013"): published 49 articles
- [2012](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/2012 "Articles published in 2012"): published 2 articles

The experimentation eventually stopped, but it gave me valuable insight into what it'd feel like -- roughly -- to work full time on writing articles about JavaScript for Pony Foo. I'm quite far from that horizon, though, seeing as I haven't managed to [gather enough donations as I hoped for][4]. While _$200 a month_ for a blog **might sound like a lot**, it's not much to go on if you want to make a living out of that.
