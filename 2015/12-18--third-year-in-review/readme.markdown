<div><p>In what has now become <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/yearly-review" aria-label="Articles tagged yearly-review on Pony Foo">somewhat of a tradition</a> for me, I&#x2019;m looking back on the past year and digging up stats about the blog and my career. <em>This was definitely an interesting year in Pony Foo&#x2019;s history!</em></p></div>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<div><p>During the course of 2015, <strong>I wrote and published 67 articles</strong>, which is remarkably close to the total of 81 articles I had published so far, in previous years. For the most part, the surge of publications in 2015 can be explained by a little experiment I tried where I wanted to see what it&#x2019;d be like to blog daily. That experiment ended with the longest-standing series I&#x2019;ve written for Pony Foo, my <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/es6-in-depth" aria-label="ES6 in Depth on Pony Foo">ES6 in Depth</a> series, consisting of <em>24 articles</em> and a summarization of <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6" aria-label="ES6 Overview in 350 Bullet Points on Pony Foo">everything there is to know about ES6</a>, published over the course of a month.</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/2015" target="_blank" aria-label="Articles published in 2015">2015</a>: published 67 articles</li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/2014" target="_blank" aria-label="Articles published in 2014">2014</a>: published 30 articles</li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/2013" target="_blank" aria-label="Articles published in 2013">2013</a>: published 49 articles</li> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/2012" target="_blank" aria-label="Articles published in 2012">2012</a>: published 2 articles</li> </ul> <p>The experimentation eventually stopped, but it gave me valuable insight into what it&#x2019;d feel like &#x2013; roughly &#x2013; to work full time on writing articles about JavaScript for Pony Foo. I&#x2019;m quite far from that horizon, though, seeing as I haven&#x2019;t managed to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bevacqua" target="_blank" aria-label="My profile on Patreon">gather enough donations as I hoped for</a>. While <em>$200 a month</em> for a blog <strong>might sound like a lot</strong>, it&#x2019;s not much to go on if you want to make a living out of that.</p></div>

<div><h1 id="subscriptions-via-email">Subscriptions via email</h1> <p>Early in 2013 I added a link on the sidebar so that readers could subscribe via email, in addition to using RSS readers. The grayed subscribers in the screenshot below were registered before the first redesign &#x2013; which revolved mostly around performance. In the beginning, you could subscribe only through the sidebar. A while after that I made it so that publishing comments for the first time, which asks for an email address to render a gravatar, gives you the option of subscribing to the emailing list as well. Later this year I added a second way of subscribing, right below articles, for people that don&#x2019;t bother checking out the sidebar. Lastly, I&#x2019;ve put together <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/subscribe" aria-label="Get Subscribed to Pony Foo!">a landing page</a> where I can direct users who want to subscribe.</p> <figure><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/subscribe" aria-label="Get Subscribed to Pony Foo!"><img alt="Subscribers to Pony Foo over time" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/zUeYXVl.png"></a></figure> <p>Around a week ago, I made the graph in the screenshot above publicly accessible on the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/subscribe" aria-label="Get Subscribed to Pony Foo!">Subscribe page</a>, for the curious who asked. I had written it for my back-end a while back, but it looks pretty enough to be available to the public. I also thought it&#x2019;d be a nice touch from a transparency standpoint.</p> <p>As you can see, the most evident spike in subscribers in recent months coincides with the time when I started my daily blogging experimentation, and ramped up through the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/es6-in-depth" aria-label="ES6 in Depth on Pony Foo">ES6 in depth series</a> publications.</p> <h1 id="readership">Readership</h1> <p>Last year the blog had received roughly 250k page views. This year, it <strong>served over 650k page views</strong>, according to Google Analytics. Maybe next year it&#x2019;ll break through the <em>1 million page views</em> barrier. What makes me hopeful in that regard is the significant improvement in the second half of the year, as revealed below.</p> <figure><img alt="Page views last year on Pony Foo" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/PSB5DHD.png"></figure> <p>When it comes to individual articles, the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6" aria-label="ES6 Overview in 350 Bullet Points on Pony Foo">ES6 overview</a> went on to become the most widely read article on the blog yet, with 46k views. Here are the top articles by page views in the last year.</p> <figure><img alt="Most viewed articles last year" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZHjbqw5.png"></figure> <h1 id="design-and-maintenance">Design and Maintenance</h1> <p>This year I&#x2019;ve also spent some effort in redesigning the site to look and feel more like something designed this century.<br> Before the redesign the site was quite the eye sore &#x2013; typical for your average blog, but I didn&#x2019;t write the entire codebase from scratch to settle for average!</p> <figure><img alt="A screenshot of Pony Foo before the redesign" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/eihfWoU.jpg"></figure> <p>I based off of the logo, kept the pink that has been stuck with the blog ever since it was created, and chose a few bright colors that are used throughout the site, giving it a somewhat more vivid appearance. You can read more about the redesign in <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/redesign" aria-label="Pony Foo Gets a Face Lift on Pony Foo">the article I wrote back then</a>.</p> <p>I also made the logo sharper, added an animation for it, and very recently made it pop out on the browser <code class="md-code md-code-inline">console</code> and in an HTML comment on the site, too.</p> <figure><img alt="A screenshot of the Pony Foo logo in its different formats" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ISt6ziQ.png"></figure> <p>Behind the scenes, I added the ability to schedule articles to be published and tweeted about at some point in the future, using a <code class="md-code md-code-inline">cron</code> job. This turned out to be quite useful in allowing me to write articles in advance and then not have to worry about keeping the publication schedule in motion.</p> <h1 id="speaking-open-source-and-writing">Speaking, Open-Source, and Writing</h1> <p>In a more personal note, in 2015 I spoke <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/bevacqua/2015/" target="_blank">at nine conferences</a>, compared to <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/bevacqua/2014/" target="_blank">six in 2014</a> <em>&#x2013; which was my first year as a public speaker</em>. Travel can be a lot of fun, meeting new people and going to faraway new places, but it also takes a lot of your time. A balance is hard to reach, but the experience makes it worth it.</p> <p>Near the start of year I open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula" target="_blank" aria-label="bevacqua/dragula on GitHub"><code class="md-code md-code-inline">dragula</code></a> and it seemed to hit a nerve in people who just couldn&#x2019;t be bothered with drag &amp; drop. <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/why-i-write-plain-javascript-modules" aria-label="Why I Write Plain JavaScript Modules on Pony Foo">As I mentioned before</a>, a combination of ease of use, documentation, and the lack of a pure drag &amp; drop component that wasn&#x2019;t tied to a particular framework <em>(e.g Angular, React)</em> nor a library <em>(e.g jQuery UI)</em> drove <code class="md-code md-code-inline">dragula</code> to formidable popularity. In just 8 months it received over 200 issues, support and feature requests, as well as over 70 pull requests.</p> <figure><a href="https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula" target="_blank" aria-label="bevacqua/dragula on GitHub"><img alt="The logo for dragula -- it&apos;s awesome!" class="" src="https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula/raw/master/resources/logo.png"></a></figure> <p>When it comes to writing, I&#x2019;ve been riding a emotional roller coaster ever since I hopped onto blogging. Inspiration comes and goes, as any writer would tell you. It goes more often than I&#x2019;d like to admit, but when I feel inspired I get the idea to write insanely long article series, so I guess there&#x2019;s a good balance in there.</p> <blockquote> <p>At the moment I&#x2019;m writing a second book, although that deserves an article of its own. I&#x2019;m very excited for things to come next year. Particularly, <em><strong>I&#x2019;m getting married soon &#x2013; so that&#x2019;s awesome!</strong></em> I&#x2019;m also going to be undertaking a new job, which will lead me to once again push my boundaries and explore unknown territories.</p> <p>Things that when appropriately leveraged, in my experience, are huge drivers of learning and innovation.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I could say more about the book and my new job, but for now I&#x2019;ll just leave you with the look back on how far Pony Foo has come in three years.</p> <p>Fine, the book is <em>obviously about JavaScript</em>, but unless you were in the audience at dotJS in Paris this month, I&#x2019;ll taunt you for a little while longer before I announce the book title and the topics that are covered. I&#x2019;m really excited about this one!</p></div>
