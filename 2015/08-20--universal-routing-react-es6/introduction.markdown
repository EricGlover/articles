One thing there's to like about React for sure is that it's only the **V** in **V\*** _(View, Whatever)_. When it comes to routing in your React app, you could implement it yourself by hand or you could use [`react-router`][1]. Implementing it yourself might sound tempting at first, but `react-router` makes it easy to expand the _already-universal_ app we have with routing capabilities without having to do much different things in either the server or the browser.
