There's quite a few different ways of subscribing to Pony Foo today.

# RSS Feed

You'll then see new articles pop up on your feed reader as they come out.

# Email Subscription

You can subscribe to get email updates whenever an article comes out. You can subscribe completing [this form](/subscribe) with just your email address. You'll get a single email whenever an article comes out, containing the gist of the article and a _"Read More"_ button.

# Facebook Page

I created a [Facebook Page for Pony Foo](https://www.facebook.com/Pony-Foo-824774767640495/) a few hours ago. If you have a Facebook account you can just _Like_ the page and then you'll get updates right in your timeline as new articles come out.

I hear some people prefer following news right on Facebook instead of over email, so that's possible now too. Whenever an article comes out, the Page will be updated with a link to the article.

# On Twitter

Pony Foo [(@ponyfoo)](https://twitter.com/ponyfoo) has been on Twitter for a while now. The account automatically posts articles immediately as they come out, and from time to time I also retweet stuff with that account.

I may or may not reply to mentions, and you'll probably have better luck reaching me at [@nzgb](https://twitter.com/nzgb) -- my main Twitter account.

# Elsewhere

Articles are also usually posted to [EchoJS](http://www.echojs.com/), a JavaScript news aggregator; [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), the well-known incubator's link aggregator; and [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/), an invite-based alternative to Hacker News. While my articles aren't the only thing on these places, a lot of the content shared on these platforms is pure gold.
