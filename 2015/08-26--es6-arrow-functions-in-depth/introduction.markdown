Since you're reading these articles, I suggest you [set up Babel and `babel-node`][1], and follow along by copying the self-contained examples into a file. You can then run them using `babel-node yourfile` in the terminal. Running these examples on your own and maybe tweaking them a little bit **will help you better internalize these new features** -- even if you're just adding `console.log` statements to figure out what's going on.

> Now onto the topic of the day.

We've already kind of went over _arrow functions_ in previous articles, using them in passing without a lot of explaining going on. This article will focus mainly in arrow functions and keep the rest of ES6 in the back burner. I think that's the best way to write about ES6 -- making a single feature "stand out" in each article, and gradually adding the others and interconnecting the different concepts so that we can understand _how they interact together_. I've observed **a lot of synergy** in ES6 features, which is _awesome_. It's still important to make a gradual dive into ES6 syntax and features and not jump into the water as it's warming up, because otherwise you'll have a bad time adjusting to the new temperature -- that was probably a bad analogy, moving on.
