Progressive Web Apps attempt to solve the infamous **"Install our app, we are begging you"** interstitial banner that usually gets in the way, because most people just want to interact with your website. Instead, the progressive way shows a consistent and unobtrusive _"Add to Home Screen"_ popup. If the user clicks on the button, a shortcut to your website will be created in their phone _-- instead of redirecting them to an App Store, further disrupting their experience._

The animation below shows how the UX for the Add to Home Screen feature flows.

Once the website is installed to their home screen, the user is able to open it as if it were any other app in full screen. There's some configurable settings, but you'd probably want to have the app look and feel as close as a native application as possible.
