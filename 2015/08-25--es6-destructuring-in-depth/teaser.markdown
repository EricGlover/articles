I've briefly mentioned a few ES6 features _(and how to [get started with Babel][1])_ in the React article series I've been writing about, and now I want to **focus on the language features** themselves. I've read a _ton_ about ES6 and ES7 and it's about time we started discussing ES6 and ES7 features here in Pony Foo.
