There's only so much information you can cram into a half an hour long presentation. The [`perfschool`][1] workshopper takes a while to complete, but it gives you a much better perspective into the kind of optimizations you could be doing. The [presentation slides][2] should give you insight into all of the different tools that you could be using, as well as an overview around performance measurement, automation, budgeting, and optimization techniques.

It's usually really hard to put together a slide deck that's understandable outside of the context of the presentation. That's why I'm putting together this blog post to help you gain insight into the <mark>things I wanted to highlight</mark> in my talk.

> Brace yourself -- this is a _long_ article. I've split it into two parts so that it's easier to follow -- because common sense.

This is the **first part, and it's dedicated to gauging performance**, automating those measurements, defining a performance budget, and enforcing it. The second part of the article is dedicated to [fixing performance issues across the web stack][3]. I had quite a bit of fun writing this piece, I hope you have _at least half as much fun_ reading it!

# Update: _Presentation Video_ Now Available!

One of the conferences where I gave this presentation has uploaded the talk video, feel free to check it out on Vimeo. I encourage you to give me your feedback as well :)
