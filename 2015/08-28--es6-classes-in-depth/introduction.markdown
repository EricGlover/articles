> Like I did in previous articles on the series, I would love to point out that you should probably [set up Babel][1] and follow along the examples with either a REPL or the `babel-node` CLI and a file. That'll make it so much easier for you to **internalize the concepts** discussed in the series. If you aren't the _"install things on my computer"_ kind of human, you might prefer to hop on [CodePen][2] and then click on the gear icon for JavaScript -- _they have a Babel preprocessor which makes trying out ES6 a breeze._

Onwards!
