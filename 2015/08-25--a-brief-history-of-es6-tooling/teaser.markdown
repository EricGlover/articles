I wrote a few articles about React and ES6 these last few days, and today I wanted to add a bit more of context as to why I seem to be super into ES6 all of sudden. I've had an interest in ES6 for a long time, but we weren't always prepared to write code in ES6\. In this post I wanted to briefly touch on the history of ES6 tooling and why I believe that today we're in a much better place to adopt ES6 than where we were half a year ago.
