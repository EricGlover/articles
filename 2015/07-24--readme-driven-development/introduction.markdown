I don't recall exactly when, but a while back, when I was just getting my toes wet at the shores of open-source, I stumbled upon this article written by _GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner_: [Readme Driven Development][1]. While I don't quite approach development in a README-first manner, documentation certainly influences the way in which I code, write, and distribute open-source modules.

**README**-first is a powerful notion. You sit down, you design your library, flesh out an API, write it down, and get to coding. It's sort of what you would do with TDD, but **without the drawback** of intensely slowing down your pace, as writing and rewriting your tests is a _much slower proposition_ than rewriting documentation.

You don't necessarily need to flesh out the entire README before starting to code.
