First off, we have to identify the critical content of a page. In my case, what's visible below constitutes the critical content, also known as the content that's _"above the fold"_.

[![Redesign article above the fold][2]](/articles/redesign "Pony Foo Gets a Face Lift")

This is the piece of the site we want to get in the face of humans immediately. That's not just limited to blogs or other content distribution sites, web apps should also strive to serve the content above the fold as fast as possible to their users, and inlining critical CSS is an excellent way of shaving milliseconds from your load time.
