There has been a tremendous push lately towards securing the Internet, and there's been even talk about browsers warning users about visiting `http` sites, as an incentive for site owners to upgrade their services to more secure protocols. Initiatives like [Let's Encrypt][1] are spearheading the revolution, and it's about time we start getting more serious about security.

While, yes, dealing with certificates is painful and expensive, there's also ways of setting up a secure version of your sites that are free and effortless. I've recently set up `https` for `ponyfoo.com`, which went live today, and I'm glad I get to share the details of how I made that happen.
