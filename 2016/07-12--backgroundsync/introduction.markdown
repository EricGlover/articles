I can't even begin to tell you the number of times I've tried to submit a form or complete an action, only for my connection to drop and the browser to present me with an offline page. Up until now, we've been unable to deal with situations like these, and it's a pretty crappy experience for our users. Fortunately, this is where Service Workers can come to the rescue. I've previously blogged about using Service Workers to provide [offline functionality](http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/create-a-really--really-simple-offline-page-using-service-workers/10135) and dramatically speed up your load times using caching. While this is useful, there has been no way for the page to *actually* send something to the server without connectivity. [Background Sync](https://github.com/WICG/BackgroundSync/blob/master/explainer.md) is the feature that has been built to handle just such a scenario.
