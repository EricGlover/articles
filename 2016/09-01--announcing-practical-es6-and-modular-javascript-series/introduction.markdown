**TL;DR** I'm working on a series of books that explore *Modular JavaScript* in five instalments. **I'm launching [a crowdfunding campaign 🚀][campaign] to help finance the endeavor.** Drafts of the first book, *Practical Modern JavaScript*, are publicly available under [HTML][toc] format and under an [AsciiDoc source code][repo] repository on GitHub.

A while after I published [JavaScript Application Design][jsad] with Manning Publishing, I felt like writing again. JavaScript Application Design was a wonderful thing. When the pile of books arrived at my doorstep, I could finally point at a a physical thing and say "I made that" -- it was such a thrill.

Half of the book was dedicated to explaining how to lay out a build process. Most examples in those chapters relied on Grunt. Even though the explanations weren't tightly coupled to Grunt, as you could easily translate the concepts to other build tools like `Make` or `npm run`, Grunt was pervasive enough that the book had an appendix on how Grunt works, another on Gulp and `npm run`, and a few explanations of Grunt sprinkled all over the book. The other half of the book talked about modular design, REST API design, testing, asynchronous JavaScript, and how to uphold quality in applications in general. You can [look over the table of contents][jsadtoc] for a better idea of how that book was structured.

This time, I'm diving deeper.

# A New Book Series 📚

I've been working on a new book _-- alongside O'Reilly Media --_ for a while now. I originally proposed writing a single book, where I'd cover ES6 language features, modularity, universality, testing, and deployment: everything you need to know to build robust JavaScript applications. As I thought about it, however, I realized it could face the same issues I had faced with JavaScript Application design. Instead of having to explain Grunt throughout, I would have to explain ES6 throughout this one, incrementally teaching different bits of the feature set as I went. I decided to turn the book into something more modular, just as I would when faced with the same problem in code.

As a result, the idea for a **Modular JavaScript** book series was born.
