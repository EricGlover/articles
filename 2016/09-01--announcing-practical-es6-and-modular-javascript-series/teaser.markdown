Super thrilled to announce [I'm working on a new book!][campaign] Practical Modern JavaScript is the first book in a ðŸ“š series I'm dubbing **"Modular JavaScript"**, which aims to be a comprehensive, freely available, and open set of books with the mission of improving our collective understanding of modular JavaScript.

**Today, I'm launching Practical Modern JavaScript. *Help me* spread the word about [the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign][campaign]!**
