<div><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I&#x2019;m working on a series of books that explore <em>Modular JavaScript</em> in five instalments. <strong>I&#x2019;m launching <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-indiegogo" target="_blank" aria-label="Indiegogo campaign for Modular JavaScript: A Pragmatic JS Book Series">a crowdfunding campaign &#x1F680;</a> to help finance the endeavor.</strong> Drafts of the first book, <em>Practical Modern JavaScript</em>, are publicly available under <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-read" target="_blank" aria-label="Practical Modern JavaScript: Dive into ES6 and the future of JavaScript">HTML</a> format and under an <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-repo" target="_blank" aria-label="mjavascript/practical-modern-javascript on GitHub">AsciiDoc source code</a> repository on GitHub.</p> <p>A while after I published <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/books/javascript-application-design" aria-label="JavaScript Application Design: A Build-First Approach">JavaScript Application Design</a> with Manning Publishing, I felt like writing again. JavaScript Application Design was a wonderful thing. When the pile of books arrived at my doorstep, I could finally point at a a physical thing and say &#x201C;I made that&#x201D; &#x2013; it was such a thrill.</p> <p>Half of the book was dedicated to explaining how to lay out a build process. Most examples in those chapters relied on Grunt. Even though the explanations weren&#x2019;t tightly coupled to Grunt, as you could easily translate the concepts to other build tools like <code class="md-code md-code-inline">Make</code> or <code class="md-code md-code-inline">npm run</code>, Grunt was pervasive enough that the book had an appendix on how Grunt works, another on Gulp and <code class="md-code md-code-inline">npm run</code>, and a few explanations of Grunt sprinkled all over the book. The other half of the book talked about modular design, REST API design, testing, asynchronous JavaScript, and how to uphold quality in applications in general. You can <a href="https://github.com/buildfirst/buildfirst#table-of-contents" target="_blank" aria-label="Table of Contents for JavaScript Application Design on GitHub">look over the table of contents</a> for a better idea of how that book was structured.</p> <p>This time, I&#x2019;m diving deeper.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Let&#x2019;s improve our collective understanding of writing robust, well-tested, modular JavaScript code.</em></p> </blockquote> <h1 id="a-new-book-series">A New Book Series &#x1F4DA;</h1> <p>I&#x2019;ve been working on a new book <em>&#x2013; alongside O&#x2019;Reilly Media &#x2013;</em> for a while now. I originally proposed writing a single book, where I&#x2019;d cover ES6 language features, modularity, universality, testing, and deployment: everything you need to know to build robust JavaScript applications. As I thought about it, however, I realized it could face the same issues I had faced with JavaScript Application design. Instead of having to explain Grunt throughout, I would have to explain ES6 throughout this one, incrementally teaching different bits of the feature set as I went. I decided to turn the book into something more modular, just as I would when faced with the same problem in code.</p> <p>As a result, the idea for a <strong>Modular JavaScript</strong> book series was born.</p> <p><a href="https://mjavascript.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Let&#x2019;s improve our collective understanding of writing robust, well-tested, modular JavaScript code."><img alt="The Modular JavaScript book series glowing over the desktop of an eager learner." class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/saRiGkb.png"></a></p> <blockquote> <p>&#x1F4B3; <strong>Participate</strong> in the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-indiegogo" target="_blank" aria-label="Indiegogo campaign for Modular JavaScript: A Pragmatic JS Book Series">crowdfunding campaign</a> on <em>Indiegogo</em><br> &#x1F424; <strong>Share</strong> a <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-tweet" target="_blank" aria-label="Send out a tweet promoting the Modular JavaScript launch">message on <em>Twitter</em></a>&#xA0;or within your social circles<br> &#x1F329; <strong>Amplify</strong> the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-thunderclap" target="_blank" aria-label="Back the Thunderclap campaign!">announcement on social media</a> via <em>Thunderclap</em><br> &#x1F4D3; <strong>Purchase</strong> the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-early-release" target="_blank" aria-label="Modular JavaScript: Practical Modern JavaScript">Early Release</a> from <em>O&#x2019;Reilly</em><br> &#x1F44F; <strong>Contribute</strong> to the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-repo-contrib" target="_blank" aria-label="mjavascript/practical-modern-javascript on GitHub">source code repository</a> on <em>GitHub</em><br> &#x1F984; <strong>Read</strong> the online <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-read" target="_blank" aria-label="Practical Modern JavaScript: Dive into ES6 and the future of JavaScript">HTML version of the book</a> on <em>Pony Foo</em></p> </blockquote></div>

<div><h1 id="the-modular-javascript-book-series">The Modular JavaScript Book Series &#x1F4E6;</h1> <p>Modern application design is hard.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgsExttW9BY" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>Modular JavaScript is an open effort to improve our collective understanding of writing robust, well-tested and modular applications. It consists of five books, each of which explores a key aspect of JavaScript development &#x2014; comprehensively. The books are produced in the open: anyone can track their progress, report issues and contribute fixes or content. A free-to-read version is available online! Digital and print books can be purchased via O&#x2019;Reilly Media.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ky0ZSQW0lBg" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>This may sound surprising if you&#x2019;ve never written a book, but the Table of Contents is something you draft before you even start writing the first page, and it typically undergoes several radical changes as the book is being developed. It could be that the content needs better flow, some topics are deemed irrelevant or out of a particular scope, or different topics that need to be introduced.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve decided to make Modular JavaScript an open effort, which is something I&#x2019;ll circle back to after describing each book in the series. First off, check out the description for each book, and their currently proposed table of contents.<br> I invite you to look them over and chime in with your opinions. The first book, Practical Modern JavaScript, is unlikely to change a lot. The rest of them are quite likely to change dramatically as they&#x2019;re developed.</p> <h1 id="book-practical-modern-javascript">Book &#x2014; Practical Modern JavaScript</h1> <div class="mde-right mde-pad-20 mde-33 mde-text-center"><p><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-read" target="_blank" aria-label="Practical Modern JavaScript: Dive into ES6 and the future of JavaScript"><img alt="Book cover for Practical Modern JavaScript" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/DKya6OE.png"></a> <br> <sub><em>Boils down the essentials of ES6 with plain terminology and easy-to-follow code examples.</em></sub></p> </div><p>The first book, <em>already in development</em>, is dedicated to ES6. When it comes to books on a language, these tend to be more of a reference style but not so much practical. <strong>Practical Modern JavaScript</strong> aims to provide practical instances in which you could leverage the different language features, at the same time as it teaches you how each feature works.</p> <p>Code examples are meant to be readily consumable and applicable to real-world JavaScript applications. This is something I strived toward in the JavaScript Application Design book, although the code samples were sometimes a bit more contrived than they had to be.</p> <p>A friendly tone paired with wording that&#x2019;s light on jargon are aimed towards making the reading experience as pleasant as possible.</p> <p>This book will go over each feature in ES6 in detail, including how to use Babel and friends, as well as practical advice on what works and what doesn&#x2019;t.</p> <div class="mde-clearfix"></div> <details> <summary>Table of Contents</summary> <h3 id="toc-practical-modern-javascript">I.

You&#x2019;ll also get an opportunity to steer the direction of my writing efforts by reporting errors and delivering book reviews.</p> <p>This is a great way to stay in touch with me through the writing process and letting me have it when drafts are not up to your expectations, so that we can improve the book iteratively before it goes to print.</p> <p><em><strong>Purchase</strong> the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-early-release" target="_blank" aria-label="Modular JavaScript: Practical Modern JavaScript">Early Release</a> from O&#x2019;Reilly! &#x1F4D3;</em></p> <div class="mde-clearfix"></div> <h2 id="screencasts-probably">Screencasts? <em>Probably!</em></h2> <p>There&#x2019;s a lot of ways to present content, but screencasts are an ideal companion for a deep-diving book series. The idea would be to interleave some content discussed in the book with an even more practical focus &#x2013; perhaps showcasing concepts using code samples. Screencasts would be produced separately after each book goes to production <em>(an intensive copyediting and proofing process publishers undergo before a book goes to print)</em>.</p> <p>I&#x2019;d love to shoot screencasts to complement the books. <em>If the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-indiegogo" target="_blank" aria-label="Indiegogo campaign for Modular JavaScript: A Pragmatic JS Book Series">crowdfunding campaign</a> goes well, we could definitely make this a reality!</em></p> <h1 id="thanks">Thanks! &#x1F44B;</h1> <p>Thanks for reading this <em>needlessly long announcement</em> about Practical Modern JavaScript and the Modular JavaScript Book Series, and please consider sharing this piece so that more of our peers can check out <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-read" target="_blank" aria-label="Practical Modern JavaScript: Dive into ES6 and the future of JavaScript">the web version of Practical Modern JavaScript</a> and maybe even help me out with the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-indiegogo" target="_blank" aria-label="Indiegogo campaign for Modular JavaScript: A Pragmatic JS Book Series">crowdfunding campaign</a>.</p> <h1 id="where-to">Where To?</h1> <blockquote> <p>&#x1F4B3; <strong>Participate</strong> in the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-indiegogo" target="_blank" aria-label="Indiegogo campaign for Modular JavaScript: A Pragmatic JS Book Series">crowdfunding campaign</a> on <em>Indiegogo</em><br> &#x1F424; <strong>Share</strong> a <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-tweet" target="_blank" aria-label="Send out a tweet promoting the Modular JavaScript launch">message on <em>Twitter</em></a>&#xA0;or within your social circles<br> &#x1F329; <strong>Amplify</strong> the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/modular-javascript-thunderclap" target="_blank" aria-label="Back the Thunderclap campaign!">announcement on social media</a> via <em>Thunderclap</em><br> &#x1F4D3; <strong>Purchase</strong> the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-early-release" target="_blank" aria-label="Modular JavaScript: Practical Modern JavaScript">Early Release</a> from <em>O&#x2019;Reilly</em><br> &#x1F44F; <strong>Contribute</strong> to the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-repo-contrib" target="_blank" aria-label="mjavascript/practical-modern-javascript on GitHub">source code repository</a> on <em>GitHub</em><br> &#x1F984; <strong>Read</strong> the online <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/s/practical-modern-javascript-read" target="_blank" aria-label="Practical Modern JavaScript: Dive into ES6 and the future of JavaScript">HTML version of the book</a> on <em>Pony Foo</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Talk soon. &#x1F417;</p></div>
