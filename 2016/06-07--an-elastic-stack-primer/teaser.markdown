This article describes my adventures while getting initiated into the Elastic Stack. We'll be building upon the `elasticsearch` index I've set up for search in an earlier post. We'll upgrade our stack to `5.x`, incorporate `logstash` and `kibana`, so we can **consume and visualize data** _-- besides what our search interface allows_; and we'll also hone and troubleshoot our understanding of the Elastic Stack along the way.
