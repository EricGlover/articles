There are **several *far from ideal situations*** in which GitHub can become very annoying and ineffective at notifications ðŸ”” and <mark>highlighting what matters</mark>. To me, what matters most in GitHub is: reading updates to issues and pull requests, and coming across interesting repositories that people I follow star or fork.

# The Watchful Giga-org ðŸ™„

Do you belong in a large organization like [`nodeschool`][nodeschool]? Then you know what it's like to be added to a new repository every other day, and having to either unwatch those whenever they are created, set up email filters to prevent the incoming spam, or receive a barrage of emails you don't care about.

# The "Add Collaborator" Spam-Fest âœ¨

Earlier today someone published an `attention-whore` repo on GitHub. That repo lets anyone who has a few minutes to spare spam the hell out of everyone's activity feed on GitHub. The idea is to inconsiderately draw attention to a repository.

# The Death Star âš°

Have a trending repository that got featured on Hacker News or the like? Good luck finding issues and pull requests today in your activity feed.
