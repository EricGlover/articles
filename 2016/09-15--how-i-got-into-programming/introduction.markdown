Like most people in our field, I've always been fascinated with problem-solving. The painful thrill of hunting for a solution, the exhilarating relief of having found a fix ‚Äî there's nothing quite like it. When I was younger, I really enjoyed strategy games like Chess, which I played ever since I was a kid; StarCraft, a real-time strategy game I played for ten years straight; or Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game that can be described as the intersection between Poker and Chess. They presented plenty of problem-solving opportunities.

# The Early--Early Days

Five years after kindergarten _--- so that everyone understands the rough timeline, so many school systems! ---_ I made my first forays into programming. Back then I had a Computer class. Pretty much everyone was thrilled about it because, back then, Computer class just meant listening to music and chatting for half an hour. To me, Computer class was fun because I got to learn about Pascal, Flash animation and a tad of ActionScript, and bits of HTML, `bgcolor`, and  the obligatory `<marquee>` tags.

My first programs weren't fancy. Back then, making the computer ask me my first name, and then my last name, and then print both out in a single sentence made me experience levels of excitement I can't even begin to describe. I was in control. Just a few lines of code, and the computer became a relay for my commands.

A while later I experimented with the web. We used FrontPage back then, and we liked it. I must've made half a dozen websites around this time. Most of them consisted of bright green Comic Sans text on blue backgrounds. Some had essential Java applets with password prompts, and an admin panel consisting entirely of tic-tac-toe. We used `<table>` for everything back then. Everything. Tables also often involved some sort of image for the background, but it wasn't just a single image, it was one for each corner, two for each row *(left and right)*, two for each column *(top and bottom)*, and another one used for every other cell.

The web was fun. Ads ran on Flash. Sites ran on Flash. Sites had "intros", but you could skip those. I never understood why intros needed a "loading" indicator, but I added a fake one *-- because it was such a fundamental part of the experience.*

Experimenting with Flash was also fun. This was probably one of the few times I felt popular back then. During Computer classes. I made a Flash animation of a cow's face üêÆ that moved a little bit. And if you clicked parts of its face, they would swirl around, make funny sounds, and stuff like that. Really silly in retrospect, but it made me feel popular for a few minutes that day. My classmates ***liked*** my silly cow.
