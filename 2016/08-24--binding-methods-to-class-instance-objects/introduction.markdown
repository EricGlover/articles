The problem is when we have a class method such as the following.

```js
class Logger {
  printName (name = 'there') {
    this.print(`Hello ${name}`);
  }

  print (text) {
    console.log(text); 
  }
}
```

Then -- for whatever reason -- the `printName` method's context changes, expectations aren't met, exceptions are thrown, and kittens die.

```js
const logger = new Logger();
const { printName } = logger;
printName();
// <- <mark>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'print' of undefined</mark>
```

Twitter drama began with Andr√©'s salty remarks about a competing front-end framework.

The problem lies, of course, with the fact that JavaScript doesn't yet have semantics where we can easily mark every class method as bound to that  class, which is how they probably should work.

Let's look at our options.
