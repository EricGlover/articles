# A Little Backstory

Several years ago, a friend and I created a Facebook group where people could share links to newspaper articles that shouldn't have existed, such as *"How mighty is the Flying Spaguetti Monster?"*, *"Director releases seven-hour trailer... for film that lasts 30 days"*, and other gems. The group became quite popular and nowadays it has ~2500 members just because of word of mouth.

My friend added one of his friends to the group, who in turn added a friend of his, who added his sister, who is now my wife. Marian's brother went away for a few days right after adding her to the group, and I joked he had created an alt account to appeal to the male audience.

She was far and away the funniest of the bunch, always making me laugh with clever comments on some of the absurd news that were posted to the group. Eventually, I asked her out, and as they say, the rest is history.

She turned out to be the sweetest person I've ever met. I wouldn't change her for the world. Apart from being a couple, she eventually became my best friend *(even if that sounds quirky)* -- although maybe that happens to most healthy couples! I could also mention she's gorgeous, but the pictures will do that on my behalf _-- even though she claims not to be photogenic_. Did I mention she makes me laugh? That happens *pretty much continuously!*

One year, for christmas, I came up with this idea of making a terrible computer game for her. I picked Microsoft XNA _-- because I had never used it before --_ and came up with a 2D platformer game over the weekend. It even included some sound effects which were **basically sound recordings of myself saying _"argghhhh!"_** when her character died. Of course, [it's all open-source!][mx]

Not long after we started dating, I came up with the idea to keep a log of every single date we had, keeping score for the date itself and each other, leaving comments along the way. It was super fun! Low scores were usually due to first world problems such as _"not enough chocolate"_ or _"should've picked a different dessert"_.  
The scores are, in order: her score for the date, my score for the date, her score for me, my score for her, and the average scores for her, myself, and overall.

I've always been pretty self-immersed, and also started blogging around the same time we started dating. I started writing [my first book][bf] not long after, and as any author can attest to: writing a book while keeping up with a day job is hard on a relationship that just getting off the ground!

Nevertheless, she stoically stood by me as I wrote page after page. Some days I spent more time chatting with my editor than with her! Those days are over, and after a month of struggling to get the book through customs, she got to read the wedding proposal I wrote for her in the dedication of the book.

We've been going out for over three years, living together for two years, and *now* married for less than a week *(so far!)*.

> On a related note, my amazing editor _-- [Susan Conant][suco], now with O'Reilly --_ was amazing and came to the wedding party all the way from the US! ðŸŽ‰

I almost forgot to mention we put together [a small website][tiramos] for the wedding! It even had an english version -- because of Susan coming to the wedding, we didn't want to make her feel left out!
