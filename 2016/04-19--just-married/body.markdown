# Wedding Photos üì∏

Now, for the pictures! First, there was the civil wedding on friday. All through the civil wedding it was pouring rain. That made for some fun wedding pictures where everyone was holding an umbrella ‚òî  under the rain. Every weather forecast _(except for one!)_ assured there'd be thunderstorms ‚õà the next day.

Not sure if this is a thing in other parts of the world, but in üá¶üá∑ people shower you with rice. Marian dyed some rice so that it'd look better, and so the rice also matched my shirt -- which, I guess, matches this blog! _(**probably** why I bought the shirt)_.

We held the wedding party at a beautiful ranch in the outskirts of Buenos Aires. There wasn't a single raindrop, nor thunders, anywhere in sight. The whole day was relatively sunny, not windy, and just perfect. Everyone joked that their "salt crosses", eggs under their beds, and other myths had worked their magic to prevent the rain. After the wedding, in her own usual and cutesy way, Marian said to me: _"you know, we're such good people, we didn't deserve the rain!"_, and she made me chuckle. Like she does.

There were quite a few animals roaming around the ranch. It was a great thing that it didn't rain üåß, as that would've made them look for shelter, staying away from partying humans. The picture üì∑ below shows a few turkeys. There were also many chicken, a peacock, and a few others. A chicken was sighted eating chicken-flavored empanadas üåÆ, talk about cannibalism!

We hosted a little symbolic ceremony _(neither of us are religious)_, that was filled with words of love, smiles, and a particularly breath-taking wife! It was one of those moments were almost everyone ends up crying, but in a good way.

After the ceremony, we went to take some photos around the ranch, while the crowd grabbed a bite to eat.

We must have watched [Up][up] at least half a dozen times since we were first dating, and we got ourselves the absolute best looking _Up-themed_ cake we could get. Much to our surprise, it was actually edible and very tasty at that. It also took four people to cut pieces of the cake üç∞, and it never crumbled!

The cake pretty much set the theme for our whole wedding party. Once we had that, we went with an assortment of colors for some balloons to be placed in the hall, and every table had a different color too.

When it came to the hall, we kicked things off showing a video of the civil wedding and then went into the venue playing a little choreography using the [Don't Stop Me Now][dsmn] song. If you know me at all, you know how terrible I am at dancing. It took quite a few sessions for Marian to teach me just enough so that I could perform at the wedding. It was super fun, and I wasn't as nervous as I had expected! I guess I was just too happy to care.

Obviously, we danced a lot more than that! Here is a photo of us opening up the Vals session.

At big ceremonial parties in Argentina -- such as wedding parties or "Quince" _(when women turn 15 years old)_ -- there's this "Carioca Carnival" tradition where we wear silly props like ridiculous hats, maracas, little trumpets, and other similarly funny items towards the end of the celebration.

It was a day to remember.
