The `marked` package parses [Markdown][md] and converts it into HTML, making it easy to turn rendered user input - user comments, product reviews, support calls - into rich(ish) text, supporting links, bold, italic and more. Since Markdown doesn’t support JavaScript, it’s often considered immune to Cross-Site Scripting, and thus safe to use for rendering user input.

However, in reality Markdown only reduces **-- but doesn’t completely eliminate --** the risk of XSS. The following, easily exploited, XSS vulnerability in `marked` is a sobering example of the distinction.
