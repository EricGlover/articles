A while back I approached Guy from Snyk *-- a Node.js vulnerability detection and security firm --* and asked him to write about an interesting vulnerability his team identified and fixed. This blog post shows an example vulnerability and how easily things can go wrong *-- even when a package has been tested by several other users beforehand.*

Take it away, Guy!
