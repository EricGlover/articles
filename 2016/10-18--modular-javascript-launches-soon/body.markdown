# Community Endorsements! üìΩ

We've made public a few endorsement videos from folks around the community, with more to come.

The first one comes from [Jake Archibald][jake], of Google. He's a hilarious personality, but don't let the hilarity fool you **-- he's extremely knowledgeable.** Here's what Jake had to say:

Today, I shared a video from [Dan Abramov][dan], of Facebook. You may know Dan from his tireless work around the React ecosystem -- on `redux`, `react-dnd`, `react-hot-loader`, as well as on `react` itself. Dan also took the time to record a video talking about the Modular JavaScript book series project.

I'm super thankful for getting so many endorsement videos, but this means I have to release more than one a day if I want to show off all of them before the campaign launches in a week! Later today, I released another video. This one comes from [Bel√©n Curcio][okbel], of Mozilla. She likes React as well, and is working on [Coral Project][coral] in collaboration with the New York Times, Washington Post, and other news organizations.

I've taken the time to add close captioning to every video, and included a link to the full transcripts on each video's description on YouTube. As it turns out, that takes quite a bit of time! But I think accessibility is worth that time.

Recently, Suz Hinton mentioned on Twitter how accessibility is not a nice-to-have for web developers, but something we should build into our products. Products should be built with accesibility in mind **-- from the get go.**

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">if do front-end dev, you have an obligation to know how to produce accessible websites. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúspecialised knowledge‚Äù - it‚Äôs your job.</p>&mdash; Suz Hinton (@noopkat) <a href="https://twitter.com/noopkat/status/788128157585010688">October 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

# Frequently Asked Questions ‚úç

Here's a few questions I get a lot, and the answers to those questions.

##### How much of these five books has already been written? üìö

I've already written two thirds of the first book. They'll be written sequentially, since I'm the only author for the series.

##### When will the crowdfunding campaign launch? üóì

On October 25th, through Indiegogo. It'll have some awesome perks, so I highly encourage that you stay on the lookout for the campaign!

##### What else will launch that day? üöÄ

- An open-source GitHub repo, with all the contents I've written so far for Practical ES6, the first book in the series
- The HTML-based version of that same book
- An official launch announcement here on Pony Foo with even more information

##### Are there any support materials? üéí

In addition to the open-source repos on GitHub, I'm planning on shooting video screencasts to complement each book on the series. This effort will largely depend on the outcome of the crowdfunding campaign.

##### Who is helping you steer this effort? üöï

I'm largely working on this on my own. [**O'Reilly Media**][oreilly] will provide editing, proofing, and physical book distribution, which is a huge relief. I've also partnered with [**egghead.io**][egg] for the complementary screencast series. Together, they'll ensure my books and screencasts are of excellent quality.

##### Why won't you take my money already!? üí∏

On October 25th, I will!
