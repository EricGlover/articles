<div><p>Modular JavaScript is an open effort to improve our collective understanding of writing robust, well-tested &amp; modular applications. It consists of five books, each of which explores a key aspect of JavaScript development <em>&#x2014; comprehensively.</em> The books are produced in the open: anyone can track their progress, report issues &amp; contribute fixes or content. A <em>free-to-read</em> version will be available online! Digital &amp; print books will be sold by O&#x2019;Reilly Media. Details below. <strong>Thank you for your support!</strong></p></div>

<div><p>The Modular JavaScript book series is going to launch its crowdfunding campaign in a week. If you already <a href="https://twitter.com/nzgb" target="_blank" aria-label="@nzgb on Twitter">follow me on Twitter</a>, this may sound like old news.</p> <p>I want people to be excited about Modular JavaScript, but I don&#x2019;t want to spoil the surprise! Here&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s happened thus far.</p> <h1 id="pre-launch-thunderclap-campaign-img-class-tj-emoji-draggable-false-alt-src-https-twemojimaxcdncom-2-72x72-26c8png">Pre-launch Thunderclap Campaign &#x26C8;</h1> <p>We&#x2019;ve started <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/48158-modular-javascript-book-series" target="_blank" aria-label="Modular JavaScript Book Series on Thunderclap">a highly successful Thunderclap campaign</a>, which at the time of this writing has 260% support and 1.9M in social reach. Thunderclap campaigns are similar to crowdfunding, except that you contribute your <em>social reach</em> instead of hard cash. The way it works is that once the campaign ends, on November 11th, a single tweet <em>(or Facebook post)</em> will be posted to your account. The kicker is that Thunderclap posts your message alongside everyone else&#x2019;s, resulting in 260+ people tweeting about Modular JavaScript <strong>at the same time.</strong></p> <p>Quite a few of the backers for the Thunderclap campaign have some serious reach. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Smashing Magazine website">Smashing Magazine</a> contributed their 991K followers, <a href="https://twitter.com/javascriptdaily" target="_blank" aria-label="@javascriptdaily on Twitter">JavaScript Daily</a> backed us with 222K followers, <a href="https://twitter.com/leaverou" target="_blank" aria-label="@leaverou on Twitter">Lea Verou</a> chipped in with her over 72K, and so on. In total, backers have over 1.9M followers in aggregate, making for 1.9M potential people who see these tweets. That&#x2019;s the campaign&#x2019;s <em>reach</em>.</p> <p>I first saw a barrage of tweets about <strong>CSS Conf 2016</strong> on my timeline, and I was impressed by the &#x201C;shock and awe&#x201D; aspect of their social outreach &#x2013; how did they do that? After some snooping around I found <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/46409-cssconf-2016" target="_blank" aria-label="CSS Conf 2016 on Thunderclap">their Thunderclap campaign</a>, which peaked at 405K of social reach, and I knew I wanted to run one of these for Modular JavaScript.</p> <p>There&#x2019;s an <a href="https://twitter.com/mjavascript" target="_blank" aria-label="@mjavascript on Twitter">@mjavascript</a> Twitter account you can follow for everything related to the series. Upon launch, a week from now, there will be a bunch more ways to learn about the series, contribute to it with either code or donations, and read the raw content <em>&#x2013; for free &#x2013;</em> as I work on it. The same content that&#x2019;s managed on GitHub repos will also be available here on <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/">ponyfoo.com</a>, but <strong>prettified with CSS</strong> in such a way that it almost feels like any Pony Foo article you&#x2019;ve read before.</p></div>

<div><h1 id="community-endorsements-img-class-tj-emoji-draggable-false-alt-src-https-twemojimaxcdncom-2-72x72-1f4fdpng">Community Endorsements! &#x1F4FD;</h1> <p>We&#x2019;ve made public a few endorsement videos from folks around the community, with more to come.</p> <p>The first one comes from <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Jake&apos;s website">Jake Archibald</a>, of Google. He&#x2019;s a hilarious personality, but don&#x2019;t let the hilarity fool you <strong>&#x2013; he&#x2019;s extremely knowledgeable.</strong> Here&#x2019;s what Jake had to say:</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MpP4MHFrIF4" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>Today, I shared a video from <a href="https://github.com/gaearon" target="_blank" aria-label="@gaeron on GitHub">Dan Abramov</a>, of Facebook. You may know Dan from his tireless work around the React ecosystem &#x2013; on <code class="md-code md-code-inline">redux</code>, <code class="md-code md-code-inline">react-dnd</code>, <code class="md-code md-code-inline">react-hot-loader</code>, as well as on <code class="md-code md-code-inline">react</code> itself. Dan also took the time to record a video talking about the Modular JavaScript book series project.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPs9Djjjq10" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>I&#x2019;m super thankful for getting so many endorsement videos, but this means I have to release more than one a day if I want to show off all of them before the campaign launches in a week! Later today, I released another video. This one comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/okbel" target="_blank" aria-label="@okbel on Twitter">Bel&#xE9;n Curcio</a>, of Mozilla. She likes React as well, and is working on <a href="https://github.com/coralproject" target="_blank" aria-label="Coral Project is on GitHub">Coral Project</a> in collaboration with the New York Times, Washington Post, and other news organizations.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Zy3jOo_7HM" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>I&#x2019;ve taken the time to add close captioning to every video, and included a link to the full transcripts on each video&#x2019;s description on YouTube. As it turns out, that takes quite a bit of time! But I think accessibility is worth that time.</p> <p>Recently, Suz Hinton mentioned on Twitter how accessibility is not a nice-to-have for web developers, but something we should build into our products. Products should be built with accesibility in mind <strong>&#x2013; from the get go.</strong></p> <figure class="twitter-tweet-figure"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>if do front-end dev, you have an obligation to know how to produce accessible websites. It&#x2019;s not &#x201C;specialised knowledge&#x201D; - it&#x2019;s your job.</p>&#x2014; Suz Hinton (@noopkat) <a href="https://twitter.com/noopkat/status/788128157585010688">October 17, 2016</a></blockquote> </figure><h1 id="frequently-asked-questions-img-class-tj-emoji-draggable-false-alt-src-https-twemojimaxcdncom-2-72x72-270dpng">Frequently Asked Questions &#x270D;</h1> <p>Here&#x2019;s a few questions I get a lot, and the answers to those questions.</p> <h5 id="how-much-of-these-five-books-has-already-been-written-img-class-tj-emoji-draggable-false-alt-src-https-twemojimaxcdncom-2-72x72-1f4dapng">How much of these five books has already been written? &#x1F4DA;</h5> <p>I&#x2019;ve already written two thirds of the first book.
