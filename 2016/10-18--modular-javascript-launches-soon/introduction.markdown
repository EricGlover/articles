The Modular JavaScript book series is going to launch its crowdfunding campaign in a week. If you already [follow me on Twitter][nzgb], this may sound like old news.

I want people to be excited about Modular JavaScript, but I don't want to spoil the surprise! Here's what's happened thus far.

# Pre-launch Thunderclap Campaign â›ˆ

We've started [a highly successful Thunderclap campaign][clap], which at the time of this writing has 260% support and 1.9M in social reach. Thunderclap campaigns are similar to crowdfunding, except that you contribute your *social reach* instead of hard cash. The way it works is that once the campaign ends, on November 11th, a single tweet *(or Facebook post)* will be posted to your account. The kicker is that Thunderclap posts your message alongside everyone else's, resulting in 260+ people tweeting about Modular JavaScript **at the same time.**

Quite a few of the backers for the Thunderclap campaign have some serious reach. [Smashing Magazine][smash] contributed their 991K followers, [JavaScript Daily][jsd] backed us with 222K followers, [Lea Verou][lea] chipped in with her over 72K, and so on. In total, backers have over 1.9M followers in aggregate, making for 1.9M potential people who see these tweets. That's the campaign's *reach*.

I first saw a barrage of tweets about **CSS Conf 2016** on my timeline, and I was impressed by the "shock and awe" aspect of their social outreach -- how did they do that? After some snooping around I found [their Thunderclap campaign][cssct], which peaked at 405K of social reach, and I knew I wanted to run one of these for Modular JavaScript.

There's an [@mjavascript][mjavascript] Twitter account you can follow for everything related to the series. Upon launch, a week from now, there will be a bunch more ways to learn about the series, contribute to it with either code or donations, and read the raw content *-- for free --* as I work on it. The same content that's managed on GitHub repos will also be available here on [ponyfoo.com][pf], but **prettified with CSS** in such a way that it almost feels like any Pony Foo article you've read before.
