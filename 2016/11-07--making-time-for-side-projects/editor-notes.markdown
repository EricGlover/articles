When I read Brian's [Be Kind][bk] story, I immediately subscribed to his Monday Mailer newsletter. A while later I asked him if he'd be interested in writing something for Pony Foo, which he kindly agreed to. In this article, he writes about side projects. How to do **more** --- when you already do so much?

Enjoy!
