Strictly better is a term I picked up from my tenure as a Magic* player. According to the definition, a Magic card is said to be [strictly better][sb] than another when it's better in some way but isn't worse in any way.

> **Strictly better** describes a card which is, in isolation from other effects, superior to another card in at least one respect, while being worse in zero respects.

<sub>* a fantasy trading card game, it's kind of like a mix between chess and poker. _[Yeah.][mtg]_</sub>

When I say that template literals are strictly better than single and double quoted strings, I mean that they are superior in several respects while not being worse in any aspects. As noted in [the definition][sb], there's always some situations in which a "strictly better" card could in fact be worse than the other, but these situations are atypical enough that we can get away with using the "strictly better" terminology on a figurative basis.

So how exactly are template literals strictly better than single and double quoted strings? And why haven't they pervasively taken over single and double quoted strings, if that were the case?

Read on and find out.
