<div><p><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/third-year-in-review" aria-label="Third Year in Review on Pony Foo">Last year</a> I posted 67 articles. This year, Pony Foo only had 34 articles <em>&#x2014; and five of those were guest posts!</em> This brings the total article count on Pony Foo to 183 &#x2014; 184 if we count this article. I wish I had time to write more, but when I look back over last year, I guess the lower count does make sense:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/just-married" aria-label="Just Married!">Got married</a> to my <em>wonderful</em> wife Marianela! &#x1F496;</li> <li>Joined <a href="https://twitter.com/nzgb/status/714803063958077441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elastic</a></li> <li>Ran <a href="https://2016.nodeconf.com.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="NodeConf Argentina 2016">NodeConf Argentina</a></li> <li>Launched <a href="https://mjavascript.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Modular JavaScript Book Series">a book series on JavaScript</a></li> <li>Launched <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/weekly" aria-label="Get our weekly email newsletter!">Pony Foo Weekly</a></li> <li>Wrote <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/author/nicolas-bevacqua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Articles on elastic.co/blog">a handful of articles</a> for the Elastic engineering blog</li> </ul> <p>Support for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bevacqua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Nicol&#xE1;s Bevacqua on Patreon">Pony Foo on Patreon</a> dropped significantly, from around ~$200 at the end of last year to around ~$60 this year. Luckily the weekly newsletter is doing pretty well in terms of sponsored links, so that helps keep Pony Foo afloat. &#x1F4B8;</p></div>

<div><h1 id="audience-growth">Audience Growth &#x1F4C8;</h1> <p>Thanks to Pony Foo Weekly and the Modular JavaScript launch, subscriptions soared to over 6,300 subscribers today, <strong>more than 5,000 new subscribers</strong> last year alone! &#x1F48C; The chart below is <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/subscribe" aria-label="Get our weekly email newsletter!">publicly available</a> and looks quite a bit better than it used to last year.</p> <figure><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/subscribe" aria-label="Get our weekly email newsletter!"><img alt="Subscribers to Pony Foo over time" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/QnzjRhT.png"></a></figure> <p>With the vast majority of my working hours going to Elastic and Modular JavaScript, and a few minutes every day going to Pony Foo Weekly thanks to <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/most-over-engineered-blog-ever" aria-label="How Pony Foo is ridiculously over-engineered &#x2014; and why that is awesome">all the automation</a>. If it weren&#x2019;t for all the automation work that went into it, I&#x2019;d probably be spending a few hours a month on Pony Foo Weekly alone!</p> <p>Lately, I&#x2019;ve been focusing more and more on Elastic and the Modular JavaScript book series, and thus have had less time to spend on Pony Foo, open-source projects, and conference talks. Even so, Pony Foo is still growing in terms of page views. Having gotten <em>100,000 more</em> page views this year than the last one, <strong>even when I published only half as many articles</strong>, Pony Foo got over 750,000 page views this year.</p> <figure><img alt="Page views over time for last year." class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/83HKMoY.png"></figure> <p>A large part of this improvement in page views is due to search results. Where Pony Foo used to get ~200 organic search clicks per day last year, these days it hovers around ~1500 clicks on week days. This allowed Pony Foo to earn even more page views with way less content being pushed every month.</p> <figure><img alt="Organic search clicks per day in the last couple of months." class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/veplNX9.png"></figure> <p>The most well-liked article in 2016 was <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await" aria-label="Understanding JavaScript&#x2019;s async await on Pony Foo">Understanding JavaScript&#x2019;s <code class="md-code md-code-inline">async</code>/<code class="md-code md-code-inline">await</code></a>, overthrowing <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6" aria-label="ES6 Overview in 350 Bullet Points on Pony Foo">ES6 Overview in 350 Bullet Points</a> as the most widely read article in Pony Foo&#x2019;s lifetime.</p> <p>Next year, I&#x2019;m hoping to get back on the habit of writing articles periodically, but coming up with good article ideas consistently is super hard! &#x1F384;</p> <h1 id="book-reading">Book Reading &#x1F4DA;</h1> <p>I hadn&#x2019;t read all that much last year, which is the reason why I created the <a href="https://github.com/bevacqua/reads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="bevacqua/reads on GitHub"><code class="md-code md-code-inline">reads</code></a> repository on GitHub.
