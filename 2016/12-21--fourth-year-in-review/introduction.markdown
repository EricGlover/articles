[Last year][last-year] I posted 67 articles. This year, Pony Foo only had 34 articles _--- and five of those were guest posts!_ This brings the total article count on Pony Foo to 183 --- 184 if we count this article. I wish I had time to write more, but when I look back over last year, I guess the lower count does make sense:

- [Got married][married] to my *wonderful* wife Marianela! ðŸ’–
- Joined [Elastic][elastic]
- Ran [NodeConf Argentina][nodeconf]
- Launched [a book series on JavaScript][mj]
- Launched [Pony Foo Weekly][weekly]
- Wrote [a handful of articles][guest] for the Elastic engineering blog

Support for [Pony Foo on Patreon][patreon] dropped significantly, from around ~$200 at the end of last year to around ~$60 this year. Luckily the weekly newsletter is doing pretty well in terms of sponsored links, so that helps keep Pony Foo afloat. ðŸ’¸
