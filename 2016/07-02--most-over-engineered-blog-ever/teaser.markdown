With almost 3000 [commits][git] on record, I'm pretty sure that Pony Foo is one of the most, *if not the most*, over-engineered blogs ever. This article goes over how it all began as a learning experience, how it continued to be a learning experience, and how it still is a learning experience. At the same time, we'll take a look at the features I've built over the years, and what each has taught me along the way.
