Teaching myself how to develop a Node.js application, that was Pony Foo's mission upon [launch][begins]. I had just read [The Pragmatic Programmer][pragprog] and I *had* to get out of my comfort zone _-- a burning desire to try out new stuff._

This article isn't about me. Okay, it's a little about me. It's also about side-projects. Side-projects, like Pony Foo, are pretty amazing. I've learned so much from implementing this blog. For one, I've become a better writer because of it. I learned some Node.js. I learned MongoDB when I wanted persistence. When I wanted better session handling, I turned to Redis. I learned about deployments in a PaaS platform like Heroku. I then moved to AWS, and learned about so many things. I learned a decent amount of `bash`. I learned to [automate immutable deployments][immul] using Packer and the `aws` CLI. I learned system administration stuff about Debian. I learned about load balancing, scaling, `ssh`. I learned about `nginx`. I learned about Elasticsearch. At this point I'm just enumerating technologies. Let's take a step back.
