Remy Sharp wrote [an excellent piece][1] recently about his love for the web. It immediately stuck with me -- and many others, I imagine -- because of how close to home it hit. He wasn't the only one to publish his thoughts recently, though.

Unfortunately, the spirit and praise of the web in Remy's post isn't shared by many of these articles. To the contrary, the web development community is flooding in skepticism, negativity, and pessimism.

> **The web community is as opinionated as it is large.**

These days however we don't see as much constructive thinking as we see [articles about Angular 2 being too complex][6], React being "bad", Babel _(or even worse, their maintainers)_ .. -- just about anything that's popular within the community is wide open for criticism. When it comes to providing constructive criticism, though, we're sorely lacking.

The problems, however, are real. By the end of 2015 many -- myself included -- agreed that one of the hardest problem the front-end community faces right now is tooling consolidation. That is, arriving at easier-to-use tools **without** sacrificing firepower.

Earlier this month, there was a Medium rant making the rounds about how **using a sledgehammer to crack a nut** has become a difficult chore, basically repeating the premise of [an older Medium article][5] but dropping the constructive bits _(and personally attacking Babel authors -- which is why I refuse to link to it)_. Around the same time, hundreds of open-source advocates signed a [petition to GitHub][3] asking for better workflows in large open-source projects. There have also been responses to "Dear GitHub", [Dear "Dear GitHub"][4], and so on. You get the point. _People like to complain about things._

![Cracking a nut with a sledgehammer][2]

In this article I hope to look into the negativity rabbit hole, see how deep it gets, while asking ourselves how the hell we got into this mess **-- and more importantly how we could fix it.**
