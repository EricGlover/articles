During the [redesign](/articles/redesign "Pony Foo Gets a Face Lift") I was faced with a problem and I had to rethink the way I inline CSS in my blog, so I figured it'd be a good time to write about it in more detail. Critical CSS inlining is a technique you can use to speed up the performance of your web apps by, _well_, inlining the "critical" CSS in a `<style>` tag, and deferring the rest of your CSS. How does that work?
