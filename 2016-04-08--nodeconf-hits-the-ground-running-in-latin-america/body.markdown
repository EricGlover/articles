This year's conference will be a **three--day event** in sunny Buenos Aires, Argentina, held during **November 17th, 18th & 19th** at [Ciudad Cultural Konex][cck], _near Palermo_. We'll offer social events, workshops, and conference talks delivered by internationally-acclaimed, regional, and local speakers. We are expecting Noders, JavaScripters, front-enders, and programmers from all over the world.

Our topmost concern is to guarantee the most enjoyable experience to our attendees, while providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. For that reason, we recommend you read the [Code of Conduct][coc] if you haven't yet.

We'll soon be announcing important updates. We know many of you are already excited about our Call for Papers, so you'll be hearing about that soon as well.

We're also looking for sponsors, so if you're interested in sponsoring the event please contact us at [sponsorship@nodeconf.com.ar][email].

In the meantime, we suggest you [head over to the home page][subscribe] and _subscribe_ to our mailing list so that you **don't miss any of the important updates**.

Exciting adventures lie ahead!
