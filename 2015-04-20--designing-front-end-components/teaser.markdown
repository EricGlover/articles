Last monday I published an open-source library to easily take control of _drag & drop_ in the front-end, [dragula][1], and it has amassed over 2000 stars on GitHub in under a week. Previously I had published _a date picker component_, [Rome][2], that's somewhat popular among the nerds. In this article we'll discuss how you can build and isolate components that have a simple API.
