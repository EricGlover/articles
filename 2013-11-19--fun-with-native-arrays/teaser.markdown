In JavaScript, arrays can be created with the `Array` constructor, or using the `[]` convenience shortcut, which is also the preferred approach. Arrays inherit from the `Object` prototype and they haven't a special value for `typeof`, they return `'object'` too. Using `[] instanceof Array`, however, returns true. That being said, there are also _Array-like objects_ which complicate matters, [such as strings, or the `arguments` object][1]. The `arguments` object is not an instance of `Array`, but it still has a `length` property, and its values are indexed, so it can be looped like any Array.
