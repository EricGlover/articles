ECMAScript editor [@bterlson][1] reported last week that features in stage 4 were going to make it into ES2016, and there were just two features in that state. You can check out the [current state of all ECMAScript proposals][2] on GitHub.

The features in question are `Array.prototype.includes` and the exponentiation operator. We'll go over both of them explaining what they do and looking at a couple of examples -- note that these are very simple features, so we'll keep it short!

Lastly, we'll talk a little bit about where ES6 is going in the future. Shall we?
