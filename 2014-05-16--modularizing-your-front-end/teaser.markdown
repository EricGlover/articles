In the past [I've wrote][1] about a small alternative to [`async`][2], named [`contra`][3], which is _barely over 2kb_, and has the browser at its heart. It comes with the usual suspects, allowing you to craft asynchronous flows in series or concurrently, as well as a few functional methods, an event emitter implementation, and a queue which powers most of the library.
