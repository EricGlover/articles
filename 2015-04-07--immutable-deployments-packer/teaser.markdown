A correct*er* title for this series would be something along the lines of **"Automating autoscaled zero-downtime immutable deployments using plain old bash, [Packer][1], nginx, Node.js, and AWS"**, but that would've been kind of long _(although it does fit on a tweet)_. My last article on the subject was two years ago, when I wrote about [Deploying Node apps to AWS using Grunt][2]. Here's a _long overdue_ update, containing everything I've learned about deployments in the time since then.
