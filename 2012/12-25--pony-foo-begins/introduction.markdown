# Past Lives

Keep in mind this idea springed in my mind just yesterday, but I'll try to keep my development cycles **as _lean_ as possible**, in order to entertain myself. In the past most of my self-driven projects lead to nowhere because **I kept focusing on _non-functional aspects_** like performance, code-tuning, including but not limited to implementing wild and new sparkly technologies.

That approach often lead to projects where I would spend a whole year implementing and code-tuning an _MVC_ application in _ASP.NET 3_, which did all the error handling, real-time logging, corner-case handling that you could imagine, but barely consisted of a couple of forms.

This time instead, I'm eager to launch a **minimal version** of the site online _as soon as humanly possible_, and then build on it, adding features on the go. This will also give me the feel of how working with **Node.JS** on a production environment feels like.
