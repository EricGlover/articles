I held a survey last monday where I asked for feedback about the kinds of things you want me to write about. It was quite useful, and one of the topics that seem to interest quite a few people is regarding module testing. Using [tape][1], [proxyquire][2], and [sinon][3] is the best possible combination of modules when it comes to testing JavaScript applications, regardless of them being server-side or front-end code.
