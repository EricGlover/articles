Google Reader [died][1] last night. I wanted to make a brief blog post to help you rebuild (or even build from scratch) your news reading experience.

I find keeping up with tech news **vital** in my growth as the information devouring sponge I aspire to be, every day.

> I'll go over some of the tools I use, and then mention _useful sites_, as well as _bootstrapping options_.
