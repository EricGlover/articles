My website is static enough that it doesn't actually need any of this, but it's nevertheless a great excuse to get started with React and Babel. After all, this blog is the excuse that got me into Node.js, client-side MVC, `browserify`, and so on. You get the idea -- learning through experimentation works really well for me, and I guess it's like that for most people.

Here's what this article will cover.

* Using universal ES6 (server-side and client-side) through [Babel][1] and Browserify
* Using `npm run` for the whole build process
* Building an Express server-side application that serves our React app
* Building a simple server-rendered React app
* Booting that app on the client-side

If all goes well, ES6 and React may become the driving topics on Pony Foo. Let's see where this article takes us, first.
