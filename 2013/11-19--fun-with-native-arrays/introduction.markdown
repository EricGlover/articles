In this article I'll go over a few of the methods on the `Array` prototype, and explore the possibilities each of these methods unveil.

* Looping with `.forEach`
* Asserting with `.some` and `.every`
* Subtleties in `.join` and `.concat`
* Stacks and queues with `.pop`, `.push`, `.shift`, and `.unshift`
* Model mapping with `.map`
* Querying with `.filter`
* Ordering with `.sort`
* Computing with `.reduce`, `.reduceRight`
* Copying a `.slice`
* The power of `.splice`
* Lookups with `.indexOf`
* The `in` operator
* Going in `.reverse`
