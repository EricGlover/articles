* Replace `node` with `nodemon` (for _development_), which restarts the `node` process whenever relevant files change
* Use the [watch][1] task in Grunt to re-execute relevant tasks when files change
* You _should_ invest in a text editor [that saves files for you][2]!
* Using [livereload][3], so that you don't even have to refresh the browser

How the hell do we make sense of all of that, and combine them in such a way that they don't collide into each other and die? Well, **read on**.
