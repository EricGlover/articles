Creating client-side JavaScript packages is increasingly becoming a painful endeavor. We need to publish our package to different repositories such as [bower][1], [component][2], and [npm][3], and there are others! Crazy. People might be using [volo][4], [jam][5], or [Ender][6]... _Have I named enough yet?_
