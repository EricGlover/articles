I haven't gotten around to recommending any books yet, and I wanted to _break some words_ about a few reads. I'm excited about a batch of books I've just ordered on Amazon, and I wanted to share what I have to say about some of the books I've read in the past. Particularly, the timeless ones, those which aren't tied to a specific technology. Though, I'll be mentioning a couple of _JavaScript-specific_ books towards the end of the article.
