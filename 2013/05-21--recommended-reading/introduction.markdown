The authors focus on teaching a pragmatic approach to the software development process. They'll try to teach you what matters about a project, how to stay productive, and they'll provide you with an [extensive list of tips](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/10/a-pragmatic-quick-reference.html "A Pragmatic Quick Reference") you can, and probably should, apply to your day to day software development activities. In reading this book I had a lot of nodding moments, some "ah√°!" moments, and _a lot of fun_.
