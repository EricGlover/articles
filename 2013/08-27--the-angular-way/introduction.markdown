I might however be _a bit biased_, considering the application I'm working on is a **PhotoShop**esque editor in the browser, which presents the same data in _radically different_ ways.

* Layers are presented graphically, taking up large portions of the screen. They are also listed in a panel where you can delete them.
* When you select a layer it gets the typical dashed line around its edges, and it also gets highlighted in the list view.
* Similarly, properties like the dimensions of a layer show up both in a panel and define their size upon the canvas.
* The panels I've mentioned can be dragged around, collapsed, and closed.
