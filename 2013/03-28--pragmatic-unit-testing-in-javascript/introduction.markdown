_Integration level testing_ with tools such as [Selenium][1] is nice in theory, but way too impractical (you have to set up a server), and particularly slow (loading browsers and computing the recorded actions takes its toll). As such it's rarely part of build processes, and it's run manually (with a single command, but manually nonetheless).

So why is that JavaScript gets _treated so differently_ from the rest of languages?
