<div><p>We can learn a lot about usability just by <em>observing everyday objects</em>, applications and interfaces. This morning I was flying to London from Buenos Aires, when I realized <em>something awkward</em> about the UI on the plane&#x2019;s in flight system, which allows you to track the progress and duration of the flight, or occasionally watch a movie.</p></div>

<div></div>

<div><p>The UI was <em>mostly in english</em>, except for a couple of views which were bilingual, that is, english with an spanish translation below. Additionally, a portion of the flight map would, in turn, be displayed in either english or spanish. This was <strong>further aggravated</strong> by the fact that you couldn&#x2019;t really pick a language on the console, so it didn&#x2019;t really help much if you weren&#x2019;t capable of reading english, and if you were, the <strong>half-baked</strong> spanish translations just <em>got in your way</em>.</p></div>

<div><p>A similar case might be made about the <em>in flight announcements</em>. Although I didn&#x2019;t have a problem with these, personally. All of them were first announced in english, and <strong>the important ones</strong> would also be repeated in spanish. I guess you could make a point about how if an announcement is not <em><strong>&#x201C;important enough to require translation&#x201D;</strong></em>, then <em>it shouldn&#x2019;t be announced in the first place</em>, but that&#x2019;s <em>debatable</em>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Either make the experience bilingual in its entirety, or allow users to pick a language, but <em>stick to one of those</em>. Be consistent, don&#x2019;t throw a half-baked feature hybrid at your users. It&#x2019;ll just confuse them.</p> </blockquote> <p>In this particular situation, I learned that <strong>consistency</strong> is really important. Having a consistent UI design would&#x2019;ve saved me the mental leap (albeit a small one).</p> <p><img alt="usability.png" title="Don&apos;t. Pretty is nice, but usable is better" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/e0sLaK7.png"></p> <h2 id="transitioning-back-to-the-web">Transitioning back to the web.</h2> <p>A similar disservice is met on the web quite frequently. Many sites offer <em>partially translated</em> versions of their pages.</p> <p>Those which try to <strong>force a localization language upon you</strong> are even worse. Rather than referring to your <code class="md-code md-code-inline">Accept-Language</code> HTTP header, or even <code class="md-code md-code-inline">navigator.language</code> in JS, some choose to pick the default language for you <em>based on your IP address</em>. I think that <strong>this is plain wrong</strong>, even though <em>major sites</em> such as Google itself do it.</p> <blockquote> <p>You should <strong>respect</strong> the <em>default language preference</em> that a user chose, rather than fix them on your <em>best guess</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>This can be generalized for <em>just about any aspect</em> of usability. Wherever you can, let your users make their choices <em>by themselves</em>. Put yourself in the shoes of user with <em>a particular need</em>, then figure out what you would change, as the user, to make that goal easier to achieve.</p> <h2 id="one-last-thing">One last thing</h2> <p>When it comes to designing user interfaces, it&#x2019;s hard to come up with a recipe for success. I&#x2019;ve found <em>trying to impersonate the person using an interface</em> to be the best way to concoct a succint and elegant design that doesn&#x2019;t get in the way, and, at the same time, makes it <em>obvious</em> how to do what you, as the user, are trying to accomplish.</p> <blockquote> <p>A rule of thumb might be that if it doesn&#x2019;t help you <em>get there</em>, then it&#x2019;s <em>getting in the way</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Luckily, I brought with me a good book on usability design, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465067107" target="_blank" aria-label="Look up The Design of Everyday Things on Amazon">The Design of Everyday Things</a>. I didn&#x2019;t read all of it yet, but I will surely come back to this topic once I finish reading it.</p> <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465067107" target="_blank" aria-label="Look up The Design of Everyday Things on Amazon"><img alt="design-of-everyday-things.jpg" class="" src="https://i.imgur.com/7kwknYH.jpg"></a></p> <p>Happy easter!</p></div>
