The UI was _mostly in english_, except for a couple of views which were bilingual, that is, english with an spanish translation below. Additionally, a portion of the flight map would, in turn, be displayed in either english or spanish. This was **further aggravated** by the fact that you couldn't really pick a language on the console, so it didn't really help much if you weren't capable of reading english, and if you were, the **half-baked** spanish translations just _got in your way_.
