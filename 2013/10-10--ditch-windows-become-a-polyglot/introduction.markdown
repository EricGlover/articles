Early on, like most self-taught developers, I met Pascal, a language designed to teach, and I was stoked. Soon enough I was browsing the web, learning about Java applets, which were crucial to placing those prized visitor counters, tic-tac-toe challenges, and enough calculators for your website.

Hosting was fun, we had FTP, [GeoCities][2], [Angelfire][3], and many other _words-that-don't-make-any-sense-next-to-each-other_ services. Oh, life was so simple back then. A few `marquee` and `blink` tags was all we needed to promote our sites. There was no need for CSS, that's why it didn't exist. A few `<center>` tags here, a few thousand `<table>` elements there and we had a perfectly fine website _and nobody complained about it_.
