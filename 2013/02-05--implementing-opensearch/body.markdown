Next, all you have to do is reference your OpenSearch file somewhere, and reference it in site home, like this:

```html
<link rel='search' type='application/opensearchdescription+xml' title='Pony Foo' href='/opensearch.xml' />
```

You can see OpenSearch in action at [IMDb.com](http://imdb.com "IMDb"), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com "Stack Overflow"), or **right here**.
