Decorators are a fairly commonplace in modern programming languages: you have [attributes in C#][attr-csharp], they're called [annotations in Java][annot-java], there's [decorators in Python][deco-python], and so on. The syntax for JavaScript decorators is fairly similar to that of Python decorators -- which is probably the reason why the name decorator was picked out of an assortment of similarly named and equivalent language features.
