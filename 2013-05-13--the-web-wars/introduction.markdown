What once was the browser _utility library_ war, has now been settled, [jQuery][1] won that. We are now in the midst of another one, the _framework_ war, with [AngularJS][2] leading the competition. There are lots to pick from though, and it isn't anywhere near settled. Popular frameworks include [BackboneJS][3], [EmberJS][4], [SproutCore][5], [KnockoutJS][6], just to name a few.

Before **Node**, and frameworks like **Angular**, it wasn't all that common opening a web project and finding front-end code _organized in a way that scaled_. This war will probably drag on for at least a couple more years. Maybe even _indefinitely_.

As we can see on [TodoMVC][7], there are _a boatload_ of different **MV**\* frameworks out there. I expect that many of those won't make it very far, while a few will gain more traction.

I'll also be covering [CommonJS][8] vs [RequireJS][9] vs [LazyJS][10], an alternative I developed.
