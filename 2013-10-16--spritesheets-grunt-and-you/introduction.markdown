In case you've been living undersea for the last decade, I wonder how you're still breathing. Sprites are [a very old concept][1], originating in game engines, which were more performant when they just loaded a _single graphic_ containing all the frames needed to render an animation. Today, spritesheets are a well-known improvement over using a single image for each icon in modern websites, but they are still slower to gain ground than they could be.

Grunt makes this super-easy for us, and in this article I want to demonstrate exactly how I use it to generate spritesheets.
