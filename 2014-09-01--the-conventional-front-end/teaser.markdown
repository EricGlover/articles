Conventions are a great thing. Frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and [ASP.NET][1] MVC are good examples of conventional MVC implementations. Conventions are essentially sensible defaults. For example, when you call `return View()` without any arguments in [ASP.NET][1] MVC, the framework does the reasonable thing: render the default view that maps to the controller action. This type of behavior can be observed throughout the framework.
