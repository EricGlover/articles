Peter-Paul Koch -- or [@ppk][1] -- has once again [published a rupturing article titled "Stop pushing the web forward"][2] that is surely going to _set the agenda for this week_ in terms of blog posts and twitter traffic. Already, Christian Heilmann -- or [@codepo8][3] -- wrote a brief article mentioning how the conversation can get lost in the Twittersphere and how it's better to **lay out your thoughts in your own blog**, particularly if you're trying to make a thoughtful argument against something that's not just going to _meaninglessly spread like wildfire_ -- but **without any real substance** to it.
