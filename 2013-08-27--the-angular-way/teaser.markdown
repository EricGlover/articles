For the past few months I've been sailing around the world of Angular. Today I can hardly imagine myself doing day to day coding on a large front-end web application without _some kind_ of data binding framework, such as [Angular.js][1], [Backbone.js][2], and [friends][3]; and I can't believe I've done so in the past.
