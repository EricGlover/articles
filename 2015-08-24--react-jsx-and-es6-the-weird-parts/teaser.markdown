I've spent a few days working with JSX and React and I have **mixed feelings** about them. React is pretty neat, but I find that they made some very unusual choices when it comes to their API design. Then there's JSX, definitely the weirdest aspect of React -- we'll look into it as well. I've really enjoyed the ES6 and Babel experience, although I've noticed that there's a learning curve where you start to decide whether using an ES6 feature is better than its ES5 equivalent or not, something we'll explore towards the end of the article.
