A couple of weeks ago I've started putting together [Stompflow][1] _(although the name only came to life two days ago!)_, and it has a blog up. The blog is actually a fork of [ponyfoo/ponyfoo][2], where the styles match the product we're building, but other than that the platform is basically the same as this one.

> I'm really excited about this, and I'd appreciate it if you were able to contribute your thoughts and feedback.
