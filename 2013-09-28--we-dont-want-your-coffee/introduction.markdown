You can follow the discussion on [Hacker News][1].

This rant probably also holds true for [TypeScript][2], and similar. Heck, even [asm.js][3]. I know `asm` is awesome _in theory_, but have you actually tried going through [a piece of code][4] written in that? It's _garbage_, and you **aren't really supposed to do that to your everyday code base** either.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm completely fine with you sipping your fancy coffee _yourself_. My problem lies with you spilling coffee on everything you do, or trying to force-feed coffee to everyone else. Your coffee is becoming an infectious disease, and you need to stop it from spreading. Languages like CoffeeScript represent a problem to the community as a whole not because the language is inherently bad, but because you assume everyone else understands that non-sense.

> What? It's not non-sense, it's beautiful! It's JavaScript.

Newflash. It isn't JavaScript, it just compiles down to it. Stop trying to subjugate people on StackOverflow by answering their JavaScript questions with CoffeeScript code. Stop trying to get JavaScript help posting Coffee code we don't understand.
