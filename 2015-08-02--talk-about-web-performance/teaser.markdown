For the [past few months][1] I've been speaking at conferences about web performance. Unfortunately, none of those awesome conferences have published their talk videos _just yet_. I figured I'd publish a write up about the talk, the things I've learned since I started speaking about these things, and the key take-aways from my talk. The presentation [_(you can find the slides online here)_][2] is split into three parts. The **first part** covers <mark>measuring performance</mark>, or **understanding what is going on** with your site; the **second part** goes over the <mark>improvements you can make</mark> to your site, such as shrinking images or _inlining critical CSS_; and the **last part** is <mark>dedicated to the implementation</mark> explaining how you can actually **implement those improvements**, for example using [`imagemin`][3] or [`penthouse`][4]. The presentation also introduces you to [`perfschool`][5], a NodeSchool workshopper that walks you through **detailed web performance optimization scenarios**, and also shows you cat pictures while you're at it.
