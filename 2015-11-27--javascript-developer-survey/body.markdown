I'll be publishing the results in three weeks, as to ensure most people have time to fill out the form if they desire.

Besides answering the "hard data" questions I'd be very curious to hear out any comments in the "Other" fields and particularly in the last question which lets you go deeper into any topics that you felt weren't covered by the rest of the questionnaire.
