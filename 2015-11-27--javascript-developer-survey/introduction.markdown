**UPDATED:** [Results are in!][3] Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer to this poll. See you again next year!

You can find the survey on [Google Forms][1]. I've compiled a list of questions that includes some that were asked by Alex on his last survey, a few I came up with, and a few I know other people are curious about.

I encourage you to take a look and come up with your answers. They're 30 questions but the vast majority are multiple choice questions, so it shouldn't take more than a few minutes to fill out the form.
