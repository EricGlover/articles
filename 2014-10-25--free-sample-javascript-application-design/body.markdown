The book is currently undergoing the final editing, tech proofing, graphics and copy editing process. Once that's out of the way, there's just manufacturing and shipping left!

# What to expect

The book offers a new take on web development, where the build process is a first-class citizen. It **covers a wide array of topics in JavaScript development**, from design concepts such as MVC and mastering async to build and deployment techniques, as well as JavaScript basics like scopes, hoisting, and how `this` works.

Among others, you'll find:

- Insight into tailoring an automated build process and separating it into different flows
- Different tasks to perform during a build, such as linting, spriting, minification, or even [database schema upgrades][1]
- Continuous development techniques to save valuable time on a daily basis
- Tweaking a build for release with image optimization, caching, and asset hashing
- Environment configuration, protecting sensitive data, and automating deployments [over Heroku][2] and [Amazon EC2][3]
- A comparison of RequireJS, using Angular's dependency injection mechanism, and CommonJS
- An introduction to Browserify as a means to develop more modular code for the client-side
- Deep analysis of the different techniques for maintainable asynchronous flows. Callbacks, `async`, Promises, event emitters, and generators are all explored!
- Do you really need jQuery? 
- Building a Backbone application, explaining MVC in the browser, as well as taking that application further using Rendr for shared rendering
- Writing tests, of course! Tests in the server, tests in the browser, tests using `tape`. Spies in your tests, mocking dependencies, automating tests. Visual testing, performance testing
- REST API design pricinples and developing layered application architectures

Can't wait to see it in print! You can get an [early access copy today][4], though.
